Peter Schiff,#Powell claims that the level of the National Debt is sustainable but that it's on a path toward becoming unsustainable in the future. Powell knows the debt is already unsustainable that's why the #Fed has kept interest rates so low for so long and created so much #inflation.,73,552,1
Peter Schiff,#Powell was wrong to claim that the value of the dollar is a concern of the Treasury and not the #Fed. If the Fed wants to bring #inflation down to 2% the exchange rate of the dollar is extremely important. A weaker dollar will put significant upward pressure on consumer prices.,44,353,0
Peter Schiff,It's hypocrisy for @SenWarren to scold #Powell for raising interest rates to fight #inflation causing millions to lose jobs and creating a #recession when its the policies she supports that created that inflation and are destroying the purchasing power of worker's paychecks.,320,2230,1

Peter Schiff,The problem is that the #Fed can't raise rates high enough to get #inflation back down to 2% without creating a worse financial crisis than the one it created in 2008.

Peter Schiff,Broad-based weakness in the U.S. dollar and #gold surging above $1900 confirms that the #inflation problem is far from over. In fact further dollar weakness will send gold long-term bond yields commodities including oil and YoY headline #CPI to new highs. https://t.co/4wADNFmT4E,118,838,0
Peter Schiff,A one-month .1% dip in #CPI doesn't mean #inflation is cooling off. The core was up .3% which annualizes to 4% double the #Fed's 2% target.

Peter Schiff,@SenWarren Government intervention at the state and federal level is the reason rents are so high and more low income housing isn't available.

Peter Schiff,#Gold managed to end 2022 with a slight annual gain of just over 1%. In contrast #Bitcoin aka digital fool's gold is down 64%. But Bitcoin isn't out of the woods yet as it still has another full day of 2022 trading to crash. So its total 2022 loss could end up much greater.,120,1084,0
Peter Schiff,The U.S. dollar Index may have had a strong year but it ended the year on a six-month low down 10% from its Nov. high. This weakness will likely continue in 2023 with the dollar having one of its worst years ever. If I'm right the #inflation problem is about to get much worse.,117,765,0
Peter Schiff,Gold ended the year with a 2-day 1% rally closing the year at $1825. In contrast #gold stocks finished the last two days of the year flat. That indicates gold stock traders don't expect gold to begin 2023 as strong as it ended 2022. So look out for a big gold rally next week!,67,705,1

Peter Schiff,Six months ago regulators put my bank into receivership to protect customers. Since then not a single bank customer has been able to withdraw any of their money.

Peter Schiff,The Bank of #Japan blinked and pivoted in the opposite direction. After artificially holding the 10-year JGB yield at .25% the BOJ just raised the target rate to .5%.

Investors who can't do their own due diligence can rely on trusted 3rd parties with skin in the came like auditors insurance companies and consumer reports.,1,20,0
Peter Schiff,Investor should not look to government regulation for protection against fraud. Free market regulation is far more reliable. Regulators are easily captured and corrupted by those they regulate. Competition reputation and private due diligence are an investors best protection.,157,1160,1
Peter Schiff,Even though consumer prices as measured by a rigged #CPI rose by just .1% in Nov. they still rose. Many people particularly retirees struggling with a high cost of living in Oct. struggled even harder in Nov. For many people to get #inflation relief consumer prices must fall.,75,581,1
Peter Schiff,@RMinarchist 60 Minutes Austraila is claiming it as a benefit and incorporating it into its defense against my defamation lawsuit.

Peter Schiff,@elonmusk The real risk isn't to debtors but creditors. You should warn savers &amp; lenders to beware as a deepening #recession will cause the #Fed to stop raising rates and return to QE.

Peter Schiff,@CrankyArtiste That was a reflection of the times. Those criteria would not be relevant today. But there are plenty of others criteria that are relevant and which should be used to limit the suffrage. One is age.  I would raise the voting age to 28.,0,29,1

Peter Schiff,@S_Williams_Jr Yes Constitutional amendments limited states from restricting suffrage based on sex age (18) poll taxes literacy tests etc.  But voting is still a privilege not a right.,0,22,1

Peter Schiff,@jcivy91 Yes but a lesser evil is still lesser. Its a bad situation I agree. But standing on principal can result in the greater evil winning. But if you live in a state like California then you might as well vote #Libertarian. But in a swing state its not worth the risk.,7,128,0
Peter Schiff,I'm a #Libertarian at heart. Generally the best candidate on any ballot is the Libertarian. But if you vote for the best candidate you may help elect the worst candidate instead.

Peter Schiff,#Gold rose over $40 today closing back above $1700. #Silver rose $1.67 closing well above $20 18% above its Sept. low. More importantly the $GDXJ is now 20% above last week's 2.5 year low. Precious metals markets are indicating that the #Fed has likely already capitulated.,314,2203,1
Peter Schiff,The price Americans will pay for Tarp Obamacare PPP and all Govt. programs that lead to the massive build up of debt since the 2008 financial crisis is #inflation. Double digit annual inflation will soon be a way of life in America. Better get use to it and invest accordingly.,171,1149,1
Peter Schiff,We've finally reached the inflection point. Governments can either keep running budget deficits or they can fight #inflation but they can't do both. Plus they can't win an inflation fight without causing a financial crisis and #recession worse than those they caused in 2008.,693,3869,0

Peter Schiff,The decision by @trussliz to scrap the cut in the UK top marginal tax rate but keep tax cuts for lower income workers is good politics but bad economics. Tax cuts for lower income workers fuel demand &amp; #inflation. But lower marginal tax rates for higher earners can fuel supply.,66,508,0

Peter Schiff,@SpencerKSchiff That's because the Treasury bear market is just getting started. So it's just a short-term bottom. On the other hand the dollar bull market is very old as is the correction in gold's bull market. So these indicators are more significant of a meaningful reversal. Nice try though.,7,108,0
Peter Schiff,Today was a key out-side reversal day in the #dollar #gold and Treasuries. These are significant reversal patterns that strongly suggest a top in the dollar and a bottom in gold. For Treasuries I think the bottom will be proven false. Prices will soon fall through a trap door.,142,1213,1
Peter Schiff,Yesterday the BOE was every bit as resolute as the #Fed of winning the #inflation war. But today at the first sign of trouble it surrendered. Inflation has won in the UK and the British had better prepare for high inflation as a way of life. The Fed will make the same choice.,310,2002,1
Peter Schiff,Pending home sales fell 2.0% in Aug. more than twice estimates and the 3rd consecutive monthly drop. YoY sales are down by 24.2%. As sales fall prices follow. As prices fall defaults follow. As real estate wealth vanishes consumer spending falls. A financial crisis ensues.,236,1379,0
Peter Schiff,Yesterday the average rate on 30-year fixed rate mortgage hit 7.08% the first time above 7% since 2002. This is also the biggest YoY rise in mortgage rates since 1981. That year 30-year fixed rate mortgages peaked at 18.63%. Current mortgages rates still have a long way to rise.,138,809,1
Peter Schiff,"Today's sharp pivot by the BOE amounts to a key ""emperor has no clothes"" moment for central banks. They've barked loud about their mutual resolve to fight #inflation but high levels of sovereign and private debt mean they have no bite. They are paper tigers that will soon fold.",212,1551,0
Peter Schiff,SF Federal Reserve Bank Pres. Mary Daly said that while the Fed is ‚Äúresolute‚Äù about bringing down high #inflation it wants to do so ‚Äúas gently as possible‚Äù so as not to drive the economy into a downturn. Too late for that. Financial crisis on deck. The #Fed's resolve is feigned.,69,608,0
Peter Schiff,There's dissension building in the ranks of the #Fed. Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans implied that he feels the Fed may have moved to fast in raising interest rates to fight #inflation. This could be the first sign that the Fed will soon fold just like the BOE.,148,1105,1
Peter Schiff,#Apple is cutting production of the new iPhone 14 due to weaker than expected demand. This is more evidence of #inflation and #recession as weaker economies and higher prices mean consumers can't afford to buy the newest iPhones.

Peter Schiff,The more problems the world has the more the U.S. benefits because the world buys dollars whenever there's a problem even if the U.S. has a bigger problem. That props up the U.S. economy while putting more pressure on every other economy. It's our currency but their problem.,455,2885,1
Peter Schiff,‚ÄúIt's our currency but it's your problem‚Äù was made famous in 1971 by John Connally Richard Nixon's treasury secretary. But back then the problem was a weak #dollar.

Peter Schiff,Central banks spent over a decade creating #inflation while using rigged #CPI indexes to claim there wasn't enough inflation. Now that the consequences have materialized it's too late to put out the fire. What we have seen thus far with inflation is just the tip of the iceberg.,196,1075,0
Peter Schiff,"The reason governments want to ""fight"" #inflation with tax cuts and not spending cuts is that the former is popular with voters. But what voters don't understand is that only the latter will work. Tax cuts will actually make the inflation problem they're supposed to solve worse!",145,972,0
Peter Schiff,Tax cuts alone won't increase supply. Govt. must also cut spending. That's because Govt. spending is taxation and must be paid for. Cutting taxes just means Govt. must borrow more or print more. So whatever tax cuts add to the private sector Govt. debt or #inflation removes.,155,920,0
Peter Schiff,The entire world has an #inflation problem but no country is raising interest rates enough or making the cuts to government spending necessary to solve the problem. For now the #dollar's reserve currency status allows it to benefit even though its got the biggest problem.,230,1753,0

The U.S. has higher debt and #inflation now than in 1981 and both are on the rise. So yields should be higher now as well.,77,568,1
Peter Schiff,The yields on a 5-year U.S. Treasury is now 3.94% the highest since Nov. of 2007. 5.25% will be the highest in 22 years.

Peter Schiff,It's not a coincidence that 87K more IRS agents are being hired and student loan repayments will be capped at just 5% of incomes and forgiven after 10 years.

Peter Schiff,It looks like I was right all along. @elonmusk never intended to buy #Twitter. He's much to smart to do that. He was bluffing the entire time. https://t.co/ioJwllhU2F,101,1424,0

Peter Schiff,I am committed to working with the Puerto Rico banking Commissioner to resolve the capital issues with my bank for the best interest of all the bank's customers. Click the Schiff Radio link to read my full statement. https://t.co/Ih0ByqQFRA,28,379,1
Peter Schiff,When the IRS agent at the press conference admitted the investigation didn't turn out as planned that's because when the investigation started he assumed the bank was guilty. But by the time it ended he realized the bank was completely innocent. But he's pretending it's guilty.,67,902,1
Peter Schiff,Since the bank has no debt and no loans putting it into receivership still means that depositors will eventually get most of their money back. But if the Commissioner just approves the sale she fully supported for the past nine months customers can withdraw all their money now.,34,622,0
Peter Schiff,@SwagggMD They found nothing illegal. They've been sitting on the application of the sale of the bank since Jan. The sale requires the buyer to add $7 million in capital more than the bank needs. They closed it so the J5 can pretend it's being closed for tax evasion and money laundering.,2,31,0
Peter Schiff,@Crypt0Ricard0 Well if I did anything wrong I covered my tracks completely as after a massive 2.5 year 5-country investigation they did not find any criminal conduct at the bank. The truth is there were no tracks to cover as we did everything right.  We actually went above and beyond.,0,28,0
Peter Schiff,After a 2.5 year investigation the J5 found that Euro Pacific Bank had excellent compliance protocols and did everything it could to make sure customers didn't use the bank to evade taxes or launder money. But instead of praising the bank it pressured regulators to shut it down.,75,861,0
Peter Schiff,Just to clear up any potential confusion the Commissioner of OCIF made it clear during the press conference that regulators found no evidence the bank committed any financial crimes. That not only includes tax evasion and money laundering but any other possible financial crime.,36,640,0
Peter Schiff,@Sharksimus Of course I deny it. The point of my tweet is that Puerto Rico regulators were very clear they found no evidence of any financial crimes. The U.S. government filed no charges. But the media is ignoring the bank's innocence and pretending it was guilty of crimes it did not commit.,7,84,0
Peter Schiff,@JohnnySpasmodic That's the pretense but no. The bank has no debt no loans and more than enough cash to pay off every depositor in full tomorrow.,3,53,0

Peter Schiff,@1_john_2_15 That long investigation exonerated the bank. The J5 pressured OCIF to shut the bank down putting depositors at risk instead of allowing the sale as planned that would have protected all depositors to create the false impression the bank was guilty even though it was innocent.,3,52,0
Peter Schiff,Most of the news stories about my bank claim that it was closed for tax evasion &amp; money laundering even though it was made clear that those financial crimes had nothing to do with the closure. The media is supposed to expose government corruption not help them get away with it.,164,2006,0
Peter Schiff,The IRS and J5 targeted my bank due to my outspoken criticism of excess government taxation and regulation. Their illegal efforts to punish free speech deprive me of property without due process and needlessly put thousands of customers at risk actually justifies my criticism.,735,6794,1

Peter Schiff,I haven't been tweeting about the economy or markets because I'm focused on trying to #SaveTheBank. I want Puerto Rico regulators to allow the planned sale so customers will be protected with $7 million in new capital. Receivership will cause customers to needlessly lose money.,78,1126,0
Peter Schiff,@jratcliff I'm doing a lot more than venting on Twitter.  But the press has been very one-sided. So I need to get my side out. Twitter is just the beginning.,7,244,0
Peter Schiff,@1_john_2_15 The Puerto Rico government won't allow customers to have their funds supposedly for their own good. But all their money is there. If there was a run on the bank the bank can handle it even if every customer ran at once. The lengthy investigation revealed no evidence of crimes.,7,115,0
Peter Schiff,When OCIF closed my bank it imposed a $700K fine for operating a bank without a license from Feb. 9th - June 30. But on Jan. 13 the bank filed the annual license renewal and paid the $5k fee. Despite near constant communication with OCIF there was no mention of a renewal issue.,94,1472,0

Peter Schiff,@itsthatdeanguy There were at least 7 witnesses in room when she said it. Also they don't have any evidence of every telling me to put it in.,0,29,0
Peter Schiff,The only explanation is the IRS and J5 blocked the sale so they could use the closure of my bank as a successful example of their crack down on money laundering and tax evasion even though their own investigation proved the bank did nothing to facilitate any financial crimes.,108,1573,0
Peter Schiff,@DGawr Not anymore.,7,372,1
Peter Schiff,@TheChaosEngine1 It's not. That's the point. It just doesn't have enough excess regulatory capital. But since the bank has no loans it's not really needed. The rules were written for banks with risky loans on their balance sheets. My bank has none. That said regulators told me capital was Ok.,10,361,0
Peter Schiff,"Puerto Rico put my bank into receivership due to ""insolvency.""  The bank has no debt no loans and enough cash to fully cover all deposits.

Peter Schiff,@1_john_2_15 The bank isn't insolvent. It has more than enough cash on hand to pay every depositor in full tomorrow. What other bank can say that. Plus the bank itself has no debt. But regulators won't allow anyone to withdraw funds at the moment. The long investigation exonerated the bank.,1,64,0

Peter Schiff,@darshan0110 What does #Bitcoin have to do with it? I saved a lot of people money who might have paid over $60k for Bitcoin now worth less than $20k,5,355,0
Peter Schiff,Criminal investigations are supposed to be kept secret to protect the innocent in case no evidence is found to bring charges. In my case the IRS illegally leaked the investigation to the media which then convicted me of crimes there was no evidence to charge me with committing.,240,2784,0
Peter Schiff,@cryptoBartman It's supposed to be secret.  But the IRS leaked the investigation to the press.,2,52,0
Peter Schiff,@cryptoBartman I never even had to go to court as there wasn't even enough evidence to charge me. Yet the media convicted me anyway.,5,132,0
Peter Schiff,@balibrianb Yes but it was the pressure from the bad press.  The regulators wrote they blocked the sale due to bad press.  So they shut it down instead.,2,104,0
Peter Schiff,@LLCoolTurtle I doubt it.  We only had about 100 Austrian customers.  If some of them evaded taxes they did so without any help from my bank.,3,46,0
Peter Schiff,Here's another headline you won't read. Peter Schiff's bank falsely accused by the media of facilitating tax evasion and money laundering is being closed because even though it's innocent it's premature conviction by the media ruined its reputation and crippled it financially.,259,2924,0
Peter Schiff,@yukatabob Yes. I'm being punished for my political opinions. But I have a Constitutional right to express my opinions. The government has violated those rights by illegally going after me for expressing them. They deprived me of $17.5 million I was about to get from the sale of the bank.,25,417,1
Peter Schiff,@sxoliastis1 No it's still suspended. I have a buyer for the bank. But regulators won't let me sell it. They want to liquidate it so the media the IRS and the J5 can pretend it's being shut down for tax evasion and money laundering even though there was no evidence of either at the bank.,5,58,0
Peter Schiff,@csuhartanto It was several million. We have no loans. All deposits are held in accounts in large banks. We are a 100% reserve bank. Bank has no debt. The Commissioner of OCIF told me it was ok that the bank didn't have the capital as the buyer was putting it in. Then they blocked the sale.,14,228,0
Peter Schiff,@porc43267919 They should be ok in the BVI subsidiary. I think customers still have trading access.,1,14,0
Peter Schiff,Also it costs a fortune to run a small bank. That's why I never really made any money. The compliance costs are outrageous.,77,1137,0
Peter Schiff,They never let me know they objected. I found out in C&amp;D order to shut down the bank. Had they ever told the 4% stake was a problem I would have restructured the deal. I just wanted out. I had to put in $7 million in the last 2 years to cover operating losses due to bad press.,66,1116,0
Peter Schiff,@collectarmind No notice at all.  I was informed an hour before the press conference. The media knew my bank was being closed before I did. The bank's lawyer was totally blindsided too.,24,380,0
Peter Schiff,The reason regulators gave for tuning down the sale is that post sale I would own 4% of the company buying the bank. They said that due to the bad press about me they did not want me owning 4% of a bank even though the know first hand the allegations in the media are false.,65,965,0
Peter Schiff,Despite no evidence of crimes Puerto Rico regulators closed my bank anyway for net capital issues rather than allow a sale to a highly qualified buyer promising to inject capital far in excess of regulatory minimums. As a result accounts are frozen and customers may lose money.,858,6569,0
Peter Schiff,@KoalaRunt The point of my Tweet is that the internet is full of articles implying that the false allegations in 2020 are true despite the announcement that no evidence of tax evasion or money laundering was found and no charges were filed. The media is still claiming that I'm guilty.,4,151,0
Peter Schiff,Where are these news headlines? Peter Schiff vindicated. After a 2.5 year investigation authorities of 5 nations found absolutely no evidence that Euro Pacific Bank or Peter Schiff facilitated tax evasion or money laundering. Those who reported guilt prior to charges were wrong.,177,2485,0

Peter Schiff,If the U.S. economy is already in a #recession with historically low unemployment imagine how much worse this recession will become once employers react to the recession with mass layoffs. Plus as #unemployment surges consumer prices rents and interest rates will keep rising.,390,2086,0
Peter Schiff,The #Fed hiking rates too much causing a #recession isn't a policy error. The errors were thinking it could hike without causing a severe recession waiting too long to hike not hiking enough lowering rates too much in the first place and leaving rates too low for too long.,230,1715,0
Peter Schiff,@AllanLanzador Tonight for @OnLocals members. Tomorrow for everyone else.,0,36,1
Peter Schiff,The Atlanta #Fed lowered its Q2 GDP forecast to -1%. If they're right all year as #Powell insisted the strong economy could easily withstand rate hikes it was already in a #recession. Without rate cuts and QE5 the recession gets much worse. With them #inflation gets much worse.,171,1113,0
Peter Schiff,Everyone is counting on consumers to keep the #economy out of #recession. But everyone is also counting on the #Fed to successfully fight #inflation by reducing demand. Since 70% of #GDP is consumer spending unless investment increases substantially this necessitates recession.,115,1017,0
Peter Schiff,@LouisSolomon8 @Sonnenshein They sell #Bitcoin now to pay themselves their annual 2% fee. Since Bitcoin doesn't generate any yield almost all of the Bitcoin in the trust will eventually be sold to pay the fees until the fees no longer cover operating expenses at which point the fund will be closed down.,3,41,0
Peter Schiff,If @Sonnenshein really wanted to close $GBTC's 30% discount to NAV he would't file a doomed lawsuit against the SEC he'd sell #Bitcoin owned by #GBTC and use the proceeds to buy-back shares.

Investors are bracing for #recession and higher short-term interest rates than previously expected. But they're not bracing for #inflation remaining high despite both.,99,1019,1
Peter Schiff,Every time the economy enters #recession it takes a larger dose of monetary stimulus to get it out. That's because the stimulus prevents real solutions from taking place and sows the seeds of a worse recession to come. This recession will now require a fatal overdose of stimulus.,328,2360,1
Peter Schiff,Actually current real rates are closer to negative 6.5%. If Williams is correct then to reduce #inflation the #Fed needs to immediately raise interest rates to 9.5%. Since it's not even close inflation in 2023 is likely to rise from its current 8.6% not collapse down to 2.5%.,58,544,0
Peter Schiff,N.Y. Fed Pres. John Williams admitted the #Fed needs positive real interest rates to fight #inflation. He then said he expects inflation to fall to just 2.5% next year so a terminal rate of 3.5% will be enough. With current real rates -5% why would 8.5% inflation fall to 2.5%?,102,922,0

It's the similar policies enacted by European leaders as well as the #ECB that are to blame.,33,395,0
Peter Schiff,@zeroricambio @POTUS That's just wrong. The problem is zero and negative interest rates and the ECBs asset purchase program that expands the money supply and allows profligate European governments to run otherwise unsustainably large budget deficits.,2,16,0
Peter Schiff,The fact that reckless monetary and fiscal policy by the #ECB and European governments created a huge #inflation problem in the Eurozone doesn't let the #Fed #Congress #Trump or @POTUS off the hook for the inflation that resulted from their reckless monetary and fiscal policy.,39,374,0
Peter Schiff,#Powell is wrong to claim that U.S. debt is on an unsustainable path. The debt is unsustainable right now. The only things sustaining it are the QE program the #Fed is ending and the artificially low interest rates the Fed is taking away. The fiscal time bomb is about to explode.,101,777,0
Peter Schiff,"#Powell stubbornly refused to offer an opinion as to whether he thinks forgiving billions in student debt without any offsetting spending cuts or tax increases would be inflationary. Since he must know the answer is ""yes"" he obviously doesn't care if #inflation gets worse.",53,492,0
Peter Schiff,#Powell's comments can't be taken seriously as they're based on the absurd belief that U.S. real #GDP growth will be strong in the 2nd half and that he doesn't care about the huge balance sheet losses the #Fed will bill Congress or the soaring cost of servicing the National Debt.,38,414,1
Peter Schiff,#Powell's confident prediction that the U.S. economy will experience strong real GDP growth in the second half of 2022 will prove just as wrong as his earlier forecast that #inflation was transitory. Not only will GDP growth not be strong the U.S. will likely be in a #recession.,96,612,1
Peter Schiff,How can #Powell claim the #Fed doesn't even consider the impact of rising interest rates on the Federal Govt.'s $31 trillion National Debt especially since the short-term nature of that debt means that his planned rate hikes will add over $1 trillion to annual budget deficits?,69,541,1
Peter Schiff,#Powell should not be testifying before #Congress if he refuses to answer questions on fiscal policy mistakes that might make #inflation worse.

Peter Schiff,If #Democrats are so proud of their #COVID19 stimulus and claim that it did so much good then why not proudly accept the inflationary consequences of that policy? Just level with the American public and let them know that today's #inflation is the result of yesterday's stimulus.,180,1419,1

Peter Schiff,The PMI Composite Index for June unexpectedly plunged to 51.2 a 5-month low. Manufacturing tanked to a 2-year low of 52.4 and services sank to 51.6.

Peter Schiff,If the U.S. economy is already in #recession with just 3.6% #unemployment imagine how bad this recession will be once unemployment surges.

Peter Schiff,There's two problems with Powell's statement. First it's an obvious lie so why tell it? Second the very purpose of raising interest rates to fight #inflation is to change consumer behavior. To get them to spend less. So if #Powell is not lying it means #Fed policy is failing.,91,695,0

Peter Schiff,If the #Fed is serious about bringing #inflation down to 2% one way the Treasury can avoid a technical default would be to extend all maturities on Treasuries to 30 years.

Peter Schiff,Obviously the U.S. economy can't survive a 5% 10-year Treasury let alone 6%. At 5% the annual interest payments on the National Debt alone will exceed $1 trillion.

Peter Schiff,@bikramjitbhawal Why real rates will still be negative? They may be even more negative than they are now.

Peter Schiff,Fed members insist they'll bring #inflation back down to 2%. In reality most FOMC members will not live long enough to see a year when the #CPI only rises by 2%. Those days are long gone. We are reaping the whirlwind of the inflationary winds the #Fed sowed when it launched QE1.,115,897,0
Peter Schiff,The most important mistake investors are making is thinking that a #recession will solve the #inflation problem. In reality it will make it worse.

Peter Schiff,If consumer confidence is at a record low now imagine how much lower it will sink if the #Fed actually fights #inflation. Consumers will lose their #jobs watch their stock and bond portfolios collapse home equity vanish taxes raised benefits cut and debt service costs soar.,199,1146,1
Peter Schiff,High #inflation caused June Consumer Confidence to collapse to 50.2 the lowest ever. Lower than during the 2008 Financial Crisis and lower than during the Covid lockdowns. If the #Fed and the Govt. actually do what's necessary to fight inflation confidence will tank even lower.,113,676,0

Peter Schiff,@Abbas62413663 Because they should have reduced the money supply to match the reduction in the supply of goods including food and fuel. But they did the opposite. The result is soaring prices.,2,27,0
Peter Schiff,The #Fed caused high #inflation not supply shortages beyond its control. The proper monetary policy response to the reduced supply caused by the pandemic would've been to reduce demand by reducing the money supply. Instead the Fed increased demand by increasing the money supply.,202,1145,0
Peter Schiff,Clearly #inflation didn't peak. The #CPI spiked 1% in May and rose 8.6% YoY a new cycle high. But if measured properly the real YoY rate is closer to 20% the highest ever. Since the #Fed continues to fuel the inflation fire consumers will feel the heat as it gets much hotter.,553,2283,1
Peter Schiff,@commando520 I know what it should do. But it's hard to know for sure what it will do. But regardless of which way #gold goes tomorrow it's ultimately headed much higher. So if it goes down it's a buying opportunity.,3,44,1
Peter Schiff,Gold mining stocks are unlikely casualties of #inflation which increased the cost of mining gold much more than the price of #gold.

Peter Schiff,Investors are worried that rising #inflation means the #Fed will have to fight harder to contain it pushing the U.S. economy into #recession. As a result they're selling stocks. If investors realized inflation will win the fight they'd also be selling dollars and buying #gold.,105,766,1
Peter Schiff,Yields on 5-year U.S. Treasuries just hit a new high and are once again above the yield on 10-year Treasuries. This indicates that investors are waking up to the reality of #recession. But a lack on interest in #gold indicates they are still asleep to the reality of #inflation.,94,652,1

Peter Schiff,People accuse me of being mean for advocating higher taxes on the middle class. I'm not mean I'm honest. I prefer spending cuts. But elected officials must level with voters. If voters want big government but don't want high #inflation they must pay for it with higher taxes!,121,1219,0
Peter Schiff,@durtyd45 @LizClaman That's my preference. But if the government refuses to cut spending that's the only option that left.,0,5,0
Peter Schiff,@Chalks1972 @LizClaman Yes. If the government refuses to cut spending it must raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it. Otherwise the middle class will pay for it with even more #inflation. It's not what I want. I prefer spending cuts. But one or both must happend or inflation will get worse.,1,13,0
Peter Schiff,Don't miss my live appearance today on #FoxBusiness at 3:30 EDT. I'll be in studio with @LizClaman on the Claman Countdown. We will be discussing high #inflation why it's here to stay and why #Fed policy will only make it much worse.,14,245,0

Peter Schiff,One ounce of #gold now buys just 15 barrels of #oil. Historically this means either oil is expensive or gold is cheap.

Peter Schiff,The U.S. economy supposedly the strongest it's ever been contracted by 1.5% in Q1 .2% more than analysts expected. If #GDP contracts again in Q2 then the economy is officially in a #recession. If GDP contracts when the economy is so stong imagine what happens when it's weak!,141,881,0
Peter Schiff,Anyone claiming the fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic was necessary must also accept today's soaring consumer prices are an acceptable trade off.

If the economy is this week with interest rates this low the next few rate hikes will push the economy into #recession!,194,1351,0

Peter Schiff,Hedge fund manager @BillAckman admitted his mistake and sold #Netflix to cut his losses. I think Paul Tudor Jones will do the same with #Bitcoin. He was mistaken to think Bitcoin would be the fastest horse in the #inflation hedge race. Time to retire Bitcoin to the glue factory.,130,1382,1
Peter Schiff,In Q4 of 2018 despite signs of a slowing economy the #Fed indicated it would keep hiking interest rates and shrinking its balance sheet. When the #StockMarket crashed the Fed reversed course. The stock market is poised to crash again. This time the Fed claims it doesn't care.,92,683,0
Peter Schiff,Yesterday #Powell claimed the hot labor market is great for workers. Today GAP stock is down 20% (70% below its 2021 high) because those workers' paychecks have been so eviscerated by #inflation that after paying for rent food and energy there's nothing leftover to buy clothes!,72,581,1
Peter Schiff,At this point it's impossible for the #Fed to get it right as it already got it completely wrong and it's gotten it wrong for years. Instead of worrying about future mistakes the Fed might make investors must come to terms with horrific past mistakes the Fed has already made.,60,659,0
Peter Schiff,If the #Fed can do this much damage to the markets just by talking about raising interest rates and shrinking its balance sheet image what will happen if it actually does it. Then imagine what will happen when investors find out it's not enough to meaningfully reduce #inflation!,189,1270,0
Peter Schiff,The #Fed is not hawkish. At this point all it's doing is talking and what it's talking about doing is not aggressive.

In contrast The Valkyrie #Bitcoin Miners ETF is down 35%. $10K invested in gold miners = $12.5K. $10K invested in fool's gold miners = $6.5K!,44,645,1
Peter Schiff,#Powell claims we have a very hot labor market that's great for workers. The only thing hot is #inflation. The #Fed lit that fire and now worker's paychecks are burning.

Why is this a surprise? Customers have more choices and less discretionary income to split among them.,175,1739,0
Peter Schiff,When 30-year Treasury yields were 3% in April 2019 the official YoY #inflation rate was 1.8% and falling. Real yields were positive 1.2%. Today the official YoY inflation rate is 8.5% and rising. Real yields are negative 5.5%. To equal 1.2% real nominal yields must rise to 9.7%!,63,448,1
Peter Schiff,Oof! That Didn't Age Well! @schiffgold https://t.co/15aJw5pWve,36,327,1
Peter Schiff,When the BOJ is forced to aggressively raise interest rates to fight #inflation it won't just create a financial crisis in Japan but it will set into motion a far greater crisis in the U.S. as interest rates will spike world-wide. The U.S. economy and dollar are most vulnerable!,75,501,0
Peter Schiff,The Japanese yen has already fallen by 12% against the dollar so far this year. But as the Japanese rush to dump their JGBs to escape further real losses the BOJ has committed to unlimited yen printing to buy them. That means Japan is about to get hit by an #inflation tsunami.,129,884,1
Peter Schiff,When 30-year Treasury yields hit 5% 30-year mortgage rates will likely exceed 7.5%. What will happen to housing and financial markets and the economy with mortgage rates that high? Think about all the 5/1 ARMs that will reset. Where will homeowners get the extra cash to pay?,176,1212,1
Peter Schiff,The yield on 30-year U.S. Treasuries just hit 3%. If you think this is the peak think again. Without a #Fed pivot and QE5 30-year Treasury yields will likely hit 5% before year-end. But 5% won't be the peak either as even at that nominal rate real yields will still be negative!,68,459,1
Peter Schiff,Don't misinterpret the unexpected rise in housing starts and building permits as being indicative of a stong housing market.

Peter Schiff,@elonmusk I agree. But I think the board should call your bluff and accept your offer. I don't think you have the intention or the liquidity to buy #Twitter and I don't think the board will accept payment in #Dogecoin.,174,4471,1
Peter Schiff,@ZoomPianoTutor True and when they see how much money they are losing on their 40% bond allocation they will sell all of their bonds.,0,16,1
Peter Schiff,The reason bond yields are rising nearly every day is that so few people are willing to buy. But the Treasury is selling record quantities. The #Fed isn't buying so private investors won't lend for less than #inflation. So bonds will keep falling until real yields are positive!,62,569,1
Peter Schiff,I forgot that the bond market is closed tomorrow for Good Friday. So 3% yields will not arrive until Monday. Maybe we will get a stock market crash too.,31,249,1
Peter Schiff,The yields on 10 and 30-year U.S. Treasuries are now above 2.8% and 2.9% respectively. Rates could top 3% tomorrow and the #Fed has yet to raise the target Fed Funds rate above .25% - .50%. The last time yields on long #bonds exceeded 3% the target Fed Funds rate was 2.25%-2.5%!,66,426,1
Peter Schiff,The dollar is rising against the euro because the #Fed is still pretending it will fight #inflation while the #ECB is still pretending inflation is transitory. Once both banks stop pretending the dollar will fall against the euro but both currencies will collapse against #gold!,89,552,1
Peter Schiff,The #ECB announced interest rates will stay at zero until it judges #inflation will stabilize at 2% over the medium term. Eurozone inflation is currently 7.5%. How will throwing more gasoline on a fire put it out? Europeans are stuck with inflation well above 2% indefinitely!,63,449,1
Peter Schiff,Mar. retail sales rose 6.9% YoY the least since Feb. of 2021. But online sales plunged 6.4% on the month and are up just 1.8% YoY. Retail sales are not adjusted for #inflation so they're actually collapsing as consumers paying more for rent food and gas cut back on shopping.,36,263,0
Peter Schiff,According to the government March consumer prices rose by 8.5% YoY. Consumer prices are composed of the prices we pay for the stuff we import and they stuff we produce ourselves. But Mar. YoY import prices rose 12.5% and export prices rose 18.8%. That's an average rise of 15.65%!,52,367,1
Peter Schiff,March import prices surged 2.6% on the month and 12.5% YoY while export prices exploded 4.5% on the month and 18.8% YoY. Since the latter is more reflective of domestic cost it's a far more accurate measure of U.S. #inflation than the 8.5% revealed by a highly manipulated #CPI.,62,370,1

Peter Schiff,It looks like #Bitcoin couldn't hold $40K after all. Too bad @CNBC. HODLers had better hope for better luck at $30K otherwise it's a long way down. #Coinbase making a new all-time low and closing below $150 per share is not a good sign for the future of #crypto. Wake up sheeple!,128,1470,0
Peter Schiff,YoY core #CPI makes no sense. The reason economists look at monthly core and not the headline number is to smooth out short-term volatility in monthly changes. But if food &amp; energy prices rise YoY it's not volatility it's a trend. So YoY the headline number is all that matters!,35,302,1
Peter Schiff,If #inflation is Putin's fault why is core CPI up? A 6.5% rise is still more than triple the Fed's 2% target and has nothing to do with #Putin. With people spending more on food &amp; energy they should have less to spend on other goods sending those prices lower. The #Fed did this!,171,1150,0
Peter Schiff,The yield curve is no longer inverted at any point. 5s are higher than 2s 10s are higher than 5s &amp; 30s are higher than 10s with 30s the only maturity higher on the day.

But since official #inflation will be above 4% throughout the end of 2023 negative rates will be ineffective in fighting inflation. Plus long before 3.25% is reached recession will result in rate cuts and more QE!,48,414,1
Peter Schiff,The 8.5% YoY gain in March #CPI is the highest since 1981 when interest rates were 20% &amp; CPI was 13.5%. Current interest rates are .25% and using the 1981 CPI the YoY gain is likely 17%. With real rates negative 16.75% now verses positive 6.5% then #inflation is here to stay.,194,870,0
Peter Schiff,Investors are relieved that the 1.2% jump in the March #CPI or the 8.5% YoY surge the biggest gain in forty years wasn't worse. The actual rate is likely 17%! They are also taking false comfort in the less than expected .3% monthly and 6.5% YoY rise excluding food and energy.,118,782,0
Peter Schiff,@PunksMoon @CNBC Those gains are meaningless to the 50% of #Bitcoin owners who didn't buy until last year in large part due to CNBC's constant pumping!,1,37,1
Peter Schiff,The #Bitcoin coverage on @CNBC is so biased due to their crypto advertisers and parade of industry shills that today's coverage is focused on the meaningless fact that Bitcoin has recovered back above $40K rather than its 16% drop over the past two weeks or its 38% YoY plunge!,55,609,1

Peter Schiff,Those who claimed QE wouldn't cause #inflation were right. QE doesn't cause inflation QE is inflation. But QE does cause prices to rise. It's just that there can be a long lag between QE and big price increases. That's why so many still don't make the connection between the two!,94,782,0
Peter Schiff,@elonmusk @LPofMN The government is the winner as it spends the newly printed money into circulation. So purchasing power is transferred from the public to the government. Plus when the government inflates the money supply it wipes out the real value of its debt which is also owed to the public.,95,929,1

Peter Schiff,To clarify this Tweet a 2.5% interest rate is only stimulative for #inflation. It's not stimulative for the U.S. economy as it's so over-leveraged with debt that though 2.5% would be stimulative for a healthy economy it's not stimulative enough for our sick economy. Stagflation!,26,227,0
Peter Schiff,The #Fed claims it will fight #inflation by raising interest rates to a neutral rate of 2.25% - 2.5% by year-end. But you can't fight inflation by being neutral. It requires tight money. Plus 2.5% is not a neutral interest rate with an 8% inflation rate. It's highly stimulative!,113,781,1

Peter Schiff,@rhcp_steve I don't think so. With negative real yields there is still an incentive to borrow. The only change is what borrowers buy with  the money. Also negative interest rates will not encourage savings.,1,30,1

If these moves play out the dollar rally is about to reverse as crashing bonds and surging gold are #dollar bearish!,105,721,0
Peter Schiff,Bitcoin isn't a hard money alternative to the dollar or any fiat currency. #Bitcoin is neither hard nor money. It's a digit token that people collect and trade.

Interest rates must move substantially higher to reflect this reality. 10-year Treasury yields were 5% in 2008. They should be higher now!,69,593,1

Peter Schiff,@GeorgeGammon @QTRResearch I agree with that.

Peter Schiff,#Powell admitted price stability is so important to the long-term health of the labor market that the #Fed may have to keep hiking interest rates to bring #inflation down even if unemployment rises. The same would apply to asset prices falling. This resolve will soon be tested!,57,492,0
Peter Schiff,@bl4bla_ Maybe he should take off his jacket and roll up his sleeves to show how hard he is fighting #inflation.,1,43,0
Peter Schiff,The yield curve has now inverted from 5 to 10 years as 5-year Treasuries now yield more than 10-year Treasuries. This shows bond investors still don't get it. They are correct in thinking the economy is headed for recession but wrong to think that means #inflation will go away!,77,630,1
Peter Schiff,The only reason the #Fed hiked rates is #inflation. Prior to admitting inflation wasn't transitory the Fed wasn't planing any rate hikes in 2022. Given current geopolitical risks and weakness in the economy and financial markets the Fed just ran out of excuses to stay at zero!,86,731,0
Peter Schiff,On @CNBC @SenWarren claimed #inflation is caused by #Covid causing people to buy more goods and fewer services and greedy businesses gouging customers. But service sector prices are up big too and margins have fallen as businesses have not fully passed on their cost increases!,51,527,1
Peter Schiff,The #Fed is finally about to raise interest rates slightly above zero despite the highest official #inflation in 40 years and the only asset that investors think will be harmed is #gold!

Peter Schiff,Feb. export prices spiked 3% bringing the YOY rise to 16.6%. That increase reflects the cost of domestic production. Since costs to produce for export should be the same as costs to produce for domestic consumption 16.6% more accurately reflects #inflation than does a 7.9% CPI.,66,398,0

Peter Schiff,@PeterLBrandt Some bear markets are more severe with 80% to 90% declines. I think that's more likely with $ARKK.

Cathie Wood,According to @TashaARK's and @skorusARK's research $TSLA does not need autonomous ride hail to be a success: the EV opportunity alone is enormous. https://t.co/eBgDEFrZF5,177,1855,0
Cathie Wood,As with most of the technologies scaling today the dreams started in the 20-year period that ended in the tech and telecom bubble. Capital chasing the dreams back then paid huge opportunity costs. Capital realizing the dreams today could be rewarded handsomely. https://t.co/ckwMejmZLm,69,737,1
Cathie Wood,Moreover in our view Tesla remains 3-4+ years ahead of the competition in battery costs and is in a world of its own in chip design and data assets for autonomous mobility: think Apple chip design for smart phones vis a vis Nokia Motorola Ericsson and Blackberry. New world.,159,2089,1
Cathie Wood,Based on the historical demand response to a $25000 price point in gas-powered vehicles ARK's forecast that EVs will scale from ~8.5 million in 2022 to 60 million units - 75% of the market - during the next five years could be too conservative.,118,1657,1
Cathie Wood,Tesla's goal has been to drive prices down and increase #EV adoption. At Investor Day (3/1) Elon could announce a step-function drop in pricing much like he did for the Model 3 to ~$25000 for the next gen EV. Gas-powered vehicles boomed at that price point. https://t.co/eBgDEFrZF5,349,2950,0

Cathie Wood,Exact Sciences highlights the underlying profitability of many companies investing aggressively NOW to capitalize on exponential growth opportunities in this case disrupting cancer. Exact's gross margin is 73.8% compared to 43.6% for the Nasdaq and 34.1% for the S&amp;P 500. https://t.co/N0pQM12I7p,45,539,0
Cathie Wood,In our view US equity markets today are 180 degrees away from those in the tech and telecom bubble in the late nineties. Unlike the case then the technologies are ready and the costs are low enough for prime time. Investors chased the dream then. Now they are running away. ü§î,329,5351,1
Cathie Wood,The bear market last year suffocated this news even though it made a splash at ASH the American Society of Hematology conference. While one cure does not a trend make few analysts are discounting any possibility that gene editing might cure cancer.,329,5022,0
Cathie Wood,Last month BBC reported that GOSH a research hospital in the UK base edited the genome of a 12-year-old girl Alyssa suffering from leukemia. She had failed dozens of therapies and had no more options. Seven months later she is cancer- free. Not many investors know about it.,9729,77124,0
Cathie Wood,Innovation levels the playing field. @SteveCase is giving back by creating more playing fields for innovation. Thank you Steve! https://t.co/G1rWFfzLy2,21,334,1
Cathie Wood,Innovation solves problems and gains traction during tough times. Last year total auto sales dropped 8% as electric vehicle sales soared. Tesla's auto sales increased 40% during the fourth quarter and for the full year.,107,1409,0
Cathie Wood,Recently Hertz said that its EV maintenance costs are 50%+ lower than gas-powered vehicle costs. Now I understand why several of my recent Uber drivers have rented Tesla cars. In other words electric vehicle miles traveled are rising faster than expected destroying oil demand.,159,1600,0
Cathie Wood,Not only is the Nasdaq 100 heavy with FAANG but it added another $FANG Diamondback Energy when it rebalanced in December. Meanwhile the oil price has been cut nearly in half since March.

Cathie Wood,Typically an inverted yield curve is pointing to a recession and/or lower than expected inflation than expected. In our view deflation is a much bigger risk than inflation. Commodity prices and massive retail discounts are corroborating this point of view.,348,4305,1
Cathie Wood,I am wondering why economists are not highlighting that an 80bp inversion in the Treasury yield curve today is much more of a red flag for the Fed today than it was in the early ‚Äò80s. As a percent of the 3.5% 10 year Treasury yield it is ~23% today vs ~5% of 15% in the ‚Äò80s,85,1250,1
Cathie Wood,The bond market seems to be signaling that the Fed is making a serious mistake. At -80 basis points (as measured by the 10 year vs 2 year Treasury yields) the yield curve is more inverted now than at any time since the early ‚Äò80s when double-digit inflation was entrenched.,850,6398,0

Cathie Wood,Clearly we should be rooting against Depression and for the Roaring Twenties. Given conflicting data and the stark difference in these outcomes the Fed should be debating the possible risks associated with its current policy at the very least instead of voting unanimously.,138,2001,0
Cathie Wood,The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Survey is at a record low below levels hit in 2008-09 and 1979-82 a setup for a liquidity trap like that in the Great Depression when massive monetary stimulus failed.,95,1242,1
Cathie Wood,Unfortunately today has some echoes of the same. The Fed is ignoring deflationary signals and the Chips Act could harm trade perhaps more than we understand. Much like the reaction to Smoot-Harley economists have paid little attention to the potential impact of the Chips Act.,95,1447,0
Cathie Wood,If the Fed does not pivot the set-up will be more like 1929. The Fed raised rates in 1929 to squelch financial speculation and then in 1930 Congress passed Smoot-Hawley putting 50%+ tariffs on more than 20000 goods and pushing the global economy into the Great Depression.,536,5817,1
Cathie Wood,As inflation dropped to -15% in June 1921 the Fed lowered interest rates from 7% in May 1921 to 4% in July 1922 tripping the switch for the Roaring Twenties. From August 1921 to September 1929 the Dow Jones Industrial Average compounded at a annual rate of 25%.,112,1778,1
Cathie Wood,If inflation drops below the Fed's 2% target and economic activity disappoints then interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations next year ushering in this century's rendition of the Roaring Twenties.,97,1710,0
Cathie Wood,Founded in 1913 and challenged by its first bout of serious inflation the Fed raised interest rates less than two-fold from 4.6% to 7% in 1919-1920. Faced with much lower inflation this time around the Fed has increased interest rates 16-fold a serious mistake in our view.,126,1958,0
Cathie Wood,During WWI and the Spanish Flu supply chain and other shocks pushed inflation to 20%+. At its worst in June 1920 inflation peaked at 24% but then dropped precipitously in one year to -15% in June 1921. We would not be surprised to see broad-based inflation turn negative in 2023,177,2226,0
Cathie Wood,Prior to the Roaring Twenties the world was at war - WWI - and suffering a pandemic - Spanish Flu. While both had a more serious impact on the global economy today's combination is a strong echo that could result in much lower than expected inflation and a boom in innovation.,145,2343,1
Cathie Wood,If inflation is unwinding as we believe then we could be heading back to the future the Roaring Twenties the last time several general purpose technologies evolved at the same time: telephone electricity and the internal combustion engine. The setup is remarkably similar!,2819,19815,1

Cathie Wood,Disruptive innovation/Deflation: The year-over-year decline in used car prices could be worse than -23% if the shift to electric vehicles is as rapid as we expect. Auto debt is likely to convulse. https://t.co/jR4AmXZTHG,140,985,0
Cathie Wood,Much like in the mid-eighties other central banks are foreshadowing or calling for an increase in dollar liquidity. In 1985 their calls for Fed/Treasury action culminated in the Plaza and Louvre Accords. We wouldn't be surprised to see more crises force something similar.,27,221,1
Cathie Wood,Responding to the the dollar's sharp rise the BOJ and PBOC are supporting their currencies - selling dollars and buying yen and yuan - while the Swiss National Bank has tapped the Fed's dollar swap facility for two consecutive weeks which it never did in 2008-09.,24,203,1
Cathie Wood,The UK's LDI crisis was the first rip in the global financial fabric caused by the Fed's unprecedented 13-fold interest rate hike. As a result the BOE has been forced to part company with the Fed and has resumed buying instead of selling gilts.,7,81,0
Cathie Wood,Second despite record-breaking monetary stimulus during COVID the yield curve steepened only ~half as much in 2020 as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù during past crises: 150 basis points vs. 250-300. In other words the long bond market seemed to be flagging a significant deflationary undertow.,7,76,0
Cathie Wood,.@Nancy__davis is highlighting a chart that is flagging the deflationary ramifications of current Fed policy.

Cathie Wood,For those skeptical of our interest rate shock thesis (13.5x increase in the Fed funds rate in this cycle compared to 2x under Volcker) the UK pension fund LDI debacle is proof of concept.,153,1673,0
Cathie Wood,RT @ARKInvest: ARK is excited to share the exciting news of our partnership with @titanvest! Together we aim to democratize investing ena‚Ä¶,45,375,1
Cathie Wood,Japan's and China's dollar sales could be the first sign that ‚Äúmonetary easing‚Äù is on the way. The dollar's parabolic move has been devastating to the rest of the world and should come back to bite US competitiveness jobs and  and economic activity forcing the Fed to pivot.,162,1338,0
Cathie Wood,Last week Japan and China sold dollars to protect their currencies against a parabolic dollar that is causing significant harm to the global economy. In other words they are starting to ‚Äúease‚Äù dollar-based monetary policy by putting more dollars into the system.,65,705,0
Cathie Wood,By the time this Fed tackled the current surge inflation had been brewing for ~15 months not 15 years. Now it is ‚Äúkeeping at it‚Äù with a sledgehammer 13 times more powerful than the one Volcker wielded in the ‚Äò80s. In so doing the Fed could undermine its legacy.,32,387,1
Cathie Wood,The inflation surge in the late seventies/early eighties had been brewing for 15 years starting with the  Vietnam War and The Great Society social programs in 1964 and exacerbated by the end of the gold-exchange standard in 1971.,18,296,1
Cathie Wood,A 58% increase in the trade-weighted dollar since early 2008 helps to explain the deflationary forces that are building in the pipeline once again. Most commodities are priced in dollars.,17,275,1
Cathie Wood,Meanwhile commodity prices as measured by Refinitiv's CRB index have dropped ~42% since their peak in mid 2008 ~25% since their lower peak in 2011 and ~19% since an even lower peak earlier this year.,17,309,1
Cathie Wood,Under Volcker the increase in long Treasury yields was 1.6X from 10% to 16% compared to 7.4X from 0.5% to 3.7% under Powell and team. Risk aversion is pummeling all assets except cash but the Fed seems fixated on hiking rates another 100+ basis points to protect its legacy.,23,396,0
Cathie Wood,In @ARKInvest's view US monetary policy is significantly more restrictive than in the ‚Äò80s when to kill inflation Fed Chair Volcker pushed the Fed funds rate up two-fold from 10% to 20%. Chair Powell and team have increased it 13-fold from 0.25% to 3.25% to slay the dragon.,42,468,1
Cathie Wood,The yield curve ‚Äúsuggests‚Äù that US monetary policy has not been this restrictive since the ‚Äò80s. As measured by the 2-year Treasury yield relative to the 10-year Treasury yield it has inverted by 50 basis points the 10-year yield at 3.75% compared to the two-year at 4.25%.,366,2478,1

Cathie Wood,@Nouriel seems to be causing the same problem. In our view Summers Roubini and others forecasting intractable ‚Äò70's-style inflation will be blindsided by outright deflation. Headline inflation already is unwinding sequentially thanks to monetary and fiscal (ex IRA) restraint https://t.co/cUjo0fy4l8,1,14,1
Cathie Wood,Demand destruction. Gasoline demand in the US has dropped below the level hit during the depths of the coronavirus in 2020 to levels last seen 25 years ago in 1997 even though the number of cars on the road - most of them gas-powered - is much higher than it was 25 years ago. https://t.co/MO9JG4UWnf,103,791,1
Cathie Wood,RT @elonmusk: @CathieDWood Yes the fundamental error is reasoning by analogy rather than first principles,968,12947,1
Cathie Wood,This inflation started fewer than two years ago with COVID and supply chain bottlenecks exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year. The Fed is solving supply chain issues by crushing demand and in my view unleashing deflation setting it up for a major pivot.,148,1440,1
Cathie Wood,Larry Summers seems to be leading the Biden administration astray with his conviction that inflation is intractable with the ‚Äò70s as his guide. The ‚Äò70s inflation started in 1964 with the Vietnam War and the Great Society and burgeoned for 15 years. https://t.co/Sq7NbKDOW1,485,5323,1

Cathie Wood,This time around thanks to ride-hailing - and soon less expensive autonomous taxis - individuals are unlikely to prioritize auto debt payments over mortgage payments which could turn backward-looking quant models upside down.,38,896,0
Cathie Wood,If residual auto values deteriorate accordingly the $1+ trillion in US auto debt will be in harm's way. Autos were the best credit in 2008-09 as individuals prioritized their auto loan payments at the expense of mortgages so they could get to work and stay employed.,34,682,0
Cathie Wood,As measured by the Manheim used car prices dropped 4% in August (roughly 50% at an annual rate!) have dropped 10% since peaking in January and if electric vehicles are as disruptive as we believe could be cut in half hitting lows last seen during the GFC in late 2008.,37,574,1
Cathie Wood,Deflation in the pipeline heading for the PPI CPI PCE Deflator: from post-COVID price peaks lumber -60% copper -35% oil -35% iron ore -60% DRAM -46% corn -17% Baltic freight rates -79% gold -17% and silver -39%. https://t.co/nVpU1cdf1L,1101,9900,0
Cathie Wood,Innovation solves problems and the world is facing many more problems today than two years ago. Innovation is key to real growth!,85,1001,1
Cathie Wood,The Fed seems to responding to COVID-related supply shocks spanning 15 months the same way that Volcker battled inflation that had been brewing and building for 15 years. I would not be surprised to see a significant policy pivot in the next three to six months.,62,674,0
Cathie Wood,Further downstream retailers seem to be swimming in inventories which they could be forced to discount aggressively to clear the shelves for holiday merchandise. The surprise could be deflation in the CPI and PCE deflator by year-end.,20,316,0
Cathie Wood,In the pipeline inflation is turning into deflation. One of the best inflation gauges the gold price peaked more than two years ago in August 2020 at $2075 and has dropped ~15%. Lumber prices have dropped more than 60% copper -30% iron ore -60% DRAM -46% and crude oil -35%.,27,360,1
Cathie Wood,The Fed has raised the Fed funds rate 10-fold from 0.25% to 2.50% five times Volcker's 2-fold increase from 10% to 20% in the early ‚Äò80s when consumers and businesses had been adjusting to inflation for 10-15 years. In contrast today they are in shock. Housing is unraveling.,30,399,1
Cathie Wood,Not ‚Äòtil Volcker took charge in 1979 15 years after the Vietnam War and Great Society began did the Fed attack inflation decisively. In contrast faced with a two year supply-related inflation shock Powell is using Volcker's sledgehammer and I believe making a mistake.,21,294,1
Cathie Wood,At Jackson Hole Chairman Powell invoked Volcker's name twice directly twice indirectly. Today's COVID-supply-shock inflation is nothing like the ‚Äò70s inflation that started with ‚Äúguns and butter‚Äù in 1964 and accelerated after Nixon ended the gold-exchange standard in 1971.,16,268,0
Cathie Wood,The Fed is basing monetary policy decisions on lagging indicators: employment and core inflation. Leading inflation indicators like gold and copper are flagging the risk of deflation. Even the oil price has dropped more than 35% from its peak erasing most of the gain this year. https://t.co/e45KJWrjOZ,301,1922,0

Cathie Wood,‚ÄúInnovation solves problems‚Äù was my mantra during the COVID crisis. We now have a plethora of serious problems. Innovation solves problems.,196,2348,0
Cathie Wood,Finally while the cartel and a war have pushed oil prices to levels I did not expect the equivalent of a highly regressive tax has accelerated the consumer preference shift to electric vehicles. I still believe that the shift to EVs will undermine oil prices.,88,1499,1
Cathie Wood,If inventories and stock prices are leading indicators for employment and wages which in this case I believe they are then fears of cost-push inflation a la 1970's should disappear during the next six months.,58,815,0
Cathie Wood,One of the best leading indicators of inflation is gold. After soaring from $1350/ounce pre-COVID to a peak of nearly $2000 during 2020 the gold price has dropped back to $1840 during the past two years and the lumber price has dropped more than 50%.,62,814,1
Cathie Wood,Volcker doubled the Fed funds from 10% to 20% in less than a year. Powell's Fed has increased the funds rate 7-fold in the last year and is pointing to another double from here. Its moves already are more draconian than Volcker's.,78,898,1
Cathie Wood,As measured by the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is lower today than levels reached during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-09 and the two recessions in 1980-82 when Fed Chairman Volcker was choking 15%+ inflation with 20% interest rates.,68,787,1
Cathie Wood,In our view the US fell into recession during the first quarter. If massive inventors bloat real GDP in the second quarter they will unwind and hurt growth for the rest of the year. Alarmingly in early June consumer sentiment fell to a record low extending back to the 1940s.,70,817,0
Cathie Wood,Limiting the yield curve to only 150bp of steepening in the face of massive stimulus the bond market may have recognized the deflationary forces that CDSs are flagging. At the lowest end of the capitalization structure broad based equity indexes are seizing up as well.,36,603,0
Cathie Wood,The yield curve - as measured by the difference between 10 and 2 year Treasury yields - has flattened a harbinger of recession. In fact despite record breaking monetary and fiscal stimulus the yield curve steepened only to 150 basis points (1.5%) not the typical 250-300bp.,45,709,0
Cathie Wood,As measured by Markit credit default swaps (CDS) - insurance policies against bankruptcies - have doubled this year surpassing their peaks during the market rout in late 2018 and heading for COVID crisis levels. Money center bank CDS spikes are particularly concerning.,61,871,0
Cathie Wood,The Fed seems to be worried more about its legacy than the economy: it is ignoring deflationary and dangerous signals. Relying on lagging inflation indicators like the CPI Fed Governor Waller is calling for another hike of 0.75% in July.,1114,7939,0

Cathie Wood,I trust that Fed Chairman Powell and the Federal Reserve Governors and Presidents are evaluating more than the short term supply chain bottlenecks that may have been caused by over- ordering and now are showing up Walmart's and Target's record-breaking inventories!,72,1012,1
Cathie Wood,Consistent with this line of thinking credit default swaps - the price of insurance policies against default as measured by Markit - are surging the yield curve is flattening - portending disappointing growth and/or lower inflation - and stock prices are plummeting.,43,676,0
Cathie Wood,Now that the growth in M2 has declined to low single digits at an annualized rate during the last few months if the velocity of money does decline then we will be facing the risk of price deflation.,25,394,0
Cathie Wood,I believe that after flattening out for the past two years the velocity of money will resume the decline that started in 1997 and accelerated during the coronavirus. The dramatic decline in consumer sentiment and spending during the last few months corroborates this thinking.,16,411,0
Cathie Wood,US consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan - the best measure in my experience - has plunged to levels not seen since the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Consumers are rebelling against their loss of purchasing power.,41,620,1
Cathie Wood,Walmart's inventories increased 33% in nominal terms on a year over year basis translating into 20-25% in real or unit terms as Target's inventories increased by 42% and 30-35% respectively. In my 45 years in this business I have never seen such inventory excesses.,67,706,0
Cathie Wood,Important debate. In the last two days Walmart and Target reported that nominal sales increased 3-4% on a year over year basis during the quarter ended April translating into a 3-4% year over year decline in unit sales (adjusted for inflation). Their inventories are exploding. https://t.co/i4dQKM0Hbb,341,2590,0
Cathie Wood,Ridiculous. Not worthy of any other response. https://t.co/zwISYknbKB,2077,25146,0
Cathie Wood,Humble wise and brilliant. https://t.co/2s0xWWwIhx,161,1947,1
Cathie Wood,Check out @GrousARK's charts on the shift from bricks and mortar retail to online storefronts that will turn retail rents into online advertising during the next five years. https://t.co/O1ldLMpS6n,61,487,1
Cathie Wood,"Thank you @freshjiva. Stocks sold off after the tech/telecom bubble because the ""dream"" would not become reality for 20-25 years. Genomic sequencing adaptive robotics energy storage AI and blockchain technology are realities their stocks seemingly in deep value territory. https://t.co/RyhWF8hLLI",209,1812,0
Cathie Wood,Naysayers lump Zoom $ZM into profit less tech concept capital stay at home stocks. Along with Microsoft we believe that Zoom will be a prime beneficiary of the first ‚Äúrip and replace‚Äù cycle since the early nineties in the $1.5 trillion global enterprise communications space. https://t.co/2IJ8WICB1D,98,1146,1

Cathie Wood,In my view history will deem the accelerated shift toward passive funds during the last 20 years as a massive misallocation of capital.,232,3460,1
Cathie Wood,"According to @ARKInvest's research most broad-based passive funds are ""short"" disruptive innovation at a time when the global economy is undergoing the largest technological transformation in history. https://t.co/0jWICU4gAN",78,964,1
Cathie Wood,Passive funds prevented many investors from enjoying a 400-fold appreciation in $TSLA from a $1.6 billion market cap at its IPO in June 2010 to ~$650 billion when it entered the S&amp;P 500 ten years later in December 2020. https://t.co/O7n8clt1tB,490,5681,1
Cathie Wood,Really interesting thesis behind @atai_life and @COMPASSPathway as I have learned from @PierceARK and @C_Angermayer. https://t.co/TkUnyEb3ki,115,1048,1
Cathie Wood,Another metric suggests that Fed policy already is too restrictive: the dollar. Against expectations the dollar has increased more than 13% from its lows last year a real burden for emerging and other markets with dollar-denominated debt and a powerful deflationary force.,138,1500,0
Cathie Wood,Equities and bonds seem to be warning the Fed that its policy measures could cause an economic and/or financial crisis: equities are swooning and the yield curve is nearly negative territory.,428,3787,0

Cathie Wood,The economy succumbed to recession in each of those periods. Europe and China also are in difficult straits. The Fed seems to be playing with fire.,44,596,0
Cathie Wood,US consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan is lower today than it was at the depths of the coronavirus crisis. It has entered 2008-09 territory and is not far from the all time lows in the 80's when inflation and interest rates hit double digits.,38,448,1
Cathie Wood,The 10-year to 3 month yield curve is steep because the Fed is telegraphing aggressive interest rate hikes in the face of inflation that has been stoked by supply shocks. Inflation is a highly aggressive tax that is killing purchasing power and consumer sentiment.,11,278,0
Cathie Wood,Economists have learned over many cycles that the 10-2 year measure of the yield curve leads another one: the difference between the 10 year Treasury yield  and the 3 month Treasury rate. I have no idea why many strategists and economists are reverting to the latter one now.,8,222,0
Cathie Wood,Yesterday the yield curve - as measured by the difference between the 10 year Treasury and 2 year Treasury yields - inverted suggesting that the Fed is going to raise interest rates as growth and/or inflation surprise on the low side of expectations‚Ä¶which will be a mistake. https://t.co/5QNZeDWTn4,191,1286,1

Cathie Wood,Oil demand probably did hit a secular peak in 2019. The supply shock caused by the energy insecurity policies of the current US administration ESG mandates globally and now Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised prices to a point that will accelerate demand destruction. https://t.co/gaOKPSg7DK,198,1784,1

Cathie Wood,In our view fears of inflation will give way to confusion and fears of recession during the next three to six months. If so the rapid growth rates of truly innovative companies many of their equities maligned this year should be rewarded handsomely.,225,2166,1
Cathie Wood,This buildup along with M&amp;A and IPOs reminds me of Y2K. This time the excesses are likely to be  in industries that technology will disrupt: energy financial services and transportation among others. If so this disruption will be the flip side of Y2K completing the circle.,56,917,1
Cathie Wood,These developments are not new. During the third quarter real GDP was up a little more than 2% at an annual rate but real final sales - consumption investment excluding inventories government spending net exports - were flat. That 2% growth was all in inventories.,23,434,0
Cathie Wood,These percent changes are not annualized so multiply them by 12 to understand the drama unfolding here in the US. Both businesses and consumers seem to have overreacted to supply chain bottlenecks by building ‚Äúinventories‚Äù of goods while government stimulus was flowing freely.,33,489,1
Cathie Wood,As measured by the University of Michigan which I believe is the best monthly survey on the consumer sentiment during November and December dropped to a level last seen at the worst of the coronavirus crisis in 2020. In this context the percent changes listed above make sense.,22,435,0
Cathie Wood,Today we learned that in November retail inventories rose more than 2% the fastest pace since the 90's while imports jumped 4.7% and exports dropped 2%. Moreover real consumption (including services) was flat and the saving rate dropped to 6.9% below pre COVID levels.,466,3152,1

Cathie Wood,.@ARKInvest's incredible genomics team debunks myths with informed thoughtful and thorough analysis. https://t.co/iwmtY19t3J,68,949,1
Cathie Wood,RT @viktorirle: BEV share of passenger vehicles is really accelerating this year! https://t.co/jyfZEfDcRl,88,614,1
Cathie Wood,Today yes soaring food and energy prices are the equivalent of extremely regressive and oppressive tax increases. In the not-too-distant future innovation - including EVs and gene-editing - will deliver the equivalent of massive tax cuts. @ARKInvest is investing in innovation. https://t.co/tzhiODOlfI,196,2156,1
Cathie Wood,The consensus view is that inflation will remain an issue and could get worse suggesting that the equity and fixed income markets are incorporating it into discount rates. Deflation would be the bigger surprise. @ARKInvest is open minded and would like to continue this dialogue!,61,1271,0
Cathie Wood,I am struck by the behavior of millennials who at the margin are sacrificing short term consumption to pay down student loans or invest in crypto and other assets. Bank loan growth also is tepid which would not be the case if velocity were increasing.,72,1076,0
Cathie Wood,If they expect lower prices most consumers/businesses will defer purchases exacerbating a decline in the velocity of money. Despite the burst in cyclical inflation during the last year velocity is hovering at low levels. If @ARKInvest is correct the next leg will be down.,27,549,0
Cathie Wood,Inflation has flared in response to COVID-related supply chain bottlenecks and oil supply constraints but IMHO the powerful and converging deflationary forces associated with AI energy storage (EVs!) robotics genomic sequencing and blockchain technology will bend the curve. https://t.co/DxGLRWe2P6,583,4668,1
Cathie Wood,Truth always wins!,170,2866,1
Cathie Wood,In response to the near quadrupling of oil prices since the low last year electric vehicle adoption has accelerated sowing the seeds of a serious oil price decline longer term.,151,2291,1
Cathie Wood,On the supply side ESG (environmental social and governance) mandates have forced energy companies to shift capital spending from mature fossil fuels to nascent renewables. Meanwhile banks have deprived fracking companies of funding after their near-death experience in 2020.,69,1015,0
Cathie Wood,‚Ä¶,23,527,0
Cathie Wood,Oil has had three sources of support on the SUPPLY side. Global DEMAND for oil is below that in 2019 and is unlikely to return to its old high partly because its price has broken a string of lower highs and is above the $77 hit in 2018 therefore destroying demand.,63,971,0
Cathie Wood,As a result once the holiday season passes and companies face excess supplies prices should unwind. Some commodity prices - lumber and iron ore - already have dropped 50% China's crackdowns are one of the reasons. The oil price is an outlier and psychologically important.,73,1250,1
Cathie Wood,The third and most controversial source of deflation is cyclical. Because businesses shut down and were caught flat-footed as goods consumption took off during the coronavirus crisis they still are scrambling to catch up probably double- and triple-ordering beyond their needs.,70,1065,1
Cathie Wood,They leveraged their balance sheets to pay dividends and buy back shares ‚Äúmanufacturing‚Äù earnings per share. They have not invested enough in innovation and probably will be forced to service their debts by selling increasingly obsolete goods at discounts: deflation.,78,1317,1
Cathie Wood,The second secular source of deflation could be creative destruction thanks to disruptive innovation. Since the tech and telecom bust and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-09 many companies have catered to short-term oriented shareholders who want profits/dividends now‚Ä¶.,65,1100,1
Cathie Wood,When costs and prices decline velocity and disinflation - if not deflation - follow. If consumers and businesses believe that prices will fall in the future they will wait to buy buy goods and services pushing the velocity of money down.,79,1342,1
Cathie Wood,Artificial intelligence (AI) training costs for example are dropping 40-70% at an annual rate a record-breaking deflationary force. AI is likely to transform every sector industry and company during the 5 to 10 years.,258,2465,0
Cathie Wood,Now we believe that three sources of deflation will overcome the supply chain-induced inflation that is wreaking havoc on the global economy. Two sources are secular or long term and one is cyclical. Technologically enabled innovation is deflationary and the most potent source.,191,2055,0
Cathie Wood,In 2008-09 when the Fed started quantitative easing I thought that inflation would take off. I was wrong. Instead velocity - the rate at which money turns over per year - declined taking away its inflationary sting. Velocity still is falling. https://t.co/tFaXSaCKqS,2644,19158,0

Cathie Wood,By the time autos recover strongly if @skorusARK's analysis is correct the sticker prices of #ElectricVehicles will be at or below those of like-for-like gas powered vehicles suggesting that traditional auto companies will have to transform from ~95% gas to majority electric.,190,2319,0
Cathie Wood,As mass transit and ride-sharing continue to recover during the next year or so many consumers could conclude that they have prepaid too much for transportation in the form of those extra cars.,65,1183,0
Cathie Wood,Because consumers bought new and used cars to avoid mass transit during the past year the V-shaped recovery in autos was more dramatic than that after most of the more prolonged recessions during the past 50 years.,53,876,1
Cathie Wood,Back to the #auto industry the inventory glut is not on dealer lots: auto manufacturers have only 17 days of supply in the pipeline much lower than the normal 60+ days. As is the case for many goods that we stocked during the last year the inventory is in homes and garages.,49,907,1
Cathie Wood,Since spring prices of lumber have dropped 64% iron ore -51% DRAM chips -20% and copper -15%. When companies build inventories in anticipation of demand that does not materialize and inventory losses threaten their financials they sell exacerbating the price declines.,109,1181,0
Cathie Wood,Chips are not alone. After the disproportionate spending on goods that caused shortages before vaccinations became available this spring the shift to spending on services could transform other commodity shortages into gluts pushing prices down and dissipating inflation fears.,73,1068,1
Cathie Wood,We would not be surprised to see chip supplies loosen up considerably perhaps turning the problem from a shortage into a glut given the weakness in gas-powered auto demand. @elonmusk $AMD's Su and $GM's Carlisle are on record saying chip supply constraints are easing.,106,1330,0
Cathie Wood,Addressing the chip shortages in the last two weeks the Biden Administration has threatened to invoke a traditional war-time measure the Defense Production Act which would force companies to disclose supply chain information including chip inventories.,77,1200,1
Cathie Wood,In @ARKInvest's view traditional auto manufacturers have been building chip inventories since April when their US sales peaked at more than 18 million units and then dropped more than 30% (65% at an annual rate!) over the next five months to 12.2 million in September.,81,1238,1
Cathie Wood,Today $TSLA announced that in the third quarter it sold 241300 vehicles globally up 73% year over year (YoY) and 20% quarter over quarter (QOQ). Meanwhile $GM blamed the ~33% YoY decline in its US sales on chip shortages. What? #EVs require 3-5x more chips per car produced!,2781,17841,1
Cathie Wood,The rise in oil prices this year is a function more of supply than demand. At the turn of the 20th century whale oil faced the same fate and whale oil prices fluctuated dramatically. If @ARKInvest's research is correct oil prices will suffer the same fate as whale oil prices.,94,933,1
Cathie Wood,That said based on ESG mandates pension funds are demanding that oil companies cut back on capital spending while US banks in response to the collapse in oil prices last year are denying fracking companies of loans for capital spending and OPEC is holding the line on supply.,29,445,1
Cathie Wood,According to the EIA global oil demand peaked at 101 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2019 dropped to 92 mbd during the coronavirus crisis in 2020 and has rebounded to 97 mbd in 2021. Based on our forecast for EV sales @ARKInvest believes that oil demand has peaked. https://t.co/jLNkvYi22i,151,1156,1

Cathie Wood,In our view the seeds for the innovation explosion that @ARKInvest is dedicated to researching were planted during the 20 years ending with the tech and telecom bust. Having gestated for more than 20 years these technologies should transform the world during the next 10 years.,115,1970,1

Cathie Wood,The deflation in commodity prices is cyclical but is adding to the secular forces caused by technologically enabled disruptive innovation (‚Äúgood deflation‚Äù) and creative destruction (‚Äúbad deflation‚Äù).,37,787,1
Cathie Wood,Since mid May a number of commodity prices have been breaking down: lumber -65-70% copper -10-15% oil -10%. An unexpected increase in the dollar also is negative for commodity prices. Now the Mannheim used car index - a leading index for new car sales - is slipping.,45,923,1
Cathie Wood,The equity market is likely to reward disruptive innovation strategies once again when headline inflation breaks and/or fears of recession increase. If the bond market is correct one or both will be obvious during the next 3-6 months.,66,1065,1

Cathie Wood,‚ÄúThis time is different‚Äù are dangerous words in forecasting markets. Most forecasters use post World War II history as their guide. On that basis never has the equity market been higher relative to GDP. In the late 1800's however it seems to have been 2-3 times higher.,65,1255,1
Cathie Wood,Deflation should lower the velocity of money a mirror image of the seventies. If consumers and businesses expect prices to fall many will defer spending. As a result the rapid growth in global money is unlikely to unleash generalized inflation except perhaps in asset prices.,37,747,0
Cathie Wood,Bad Deflation: ‚ÄúCreative destruction‚Äù could compound the deflation. Since the tech and telecom bust many companies have catered to short-term oriented shareholders leveraging balance sheets to repurchase shares and pay dividends while neglecting to invest enough in innovation.,45,808,1
Cathie Wood,Good Deflation: The deflationary forces associated with the five major platforms evolving today could be much more powerful than those caused by telephone electricity and the automobile.,31,761,1
Cathie Wood,The technologically-enabled innovation evolving today dwarfs that of the late 1800s/early 1900s: genomic sequencing robotics energy storage artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Moreover Bitcoin could be today's ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù increasing purchasing power!,129,1153,1
Cathie Wood,As deflation pressured an increasingly difficult-to-measure nominal GDP (the denominator) exponential unit growth and rapid productivity gains increased the quality of earnings while low interest rates boosted their capitalization (the numerator).,28,792,0
Cathie Wood,Telephone electricity and the automobile were the three major technology-enabled platforms during the 50 years that ended in the Roaring Twenties. Technology-enabled platforms are deflationary thanks to learning curves or Wright's Law. The Gold Standard also was in force.,52,1069,0
Cathie Wood,In the late 1800's and early 1900's - as telephone electricity and the automobile were emerging - the US equity market cap relative to GDP appears to have been 2-3 times higher than it is today.

Cathie Wood,Companies that did not innovate and instead leveraged up to buy back stock and distribute dividends to satisfy short-term oriented shareholders including private equity will pay a steep price. They will have to cut prices to move aging inventory and service debt. Bad deflation.,244,2634,0
Cathie Wood,One more thought: @ARKInvest believes that the massive amount of disruptive innovation and good deflation evolving today is causing creative destruction and bad deflation elsewhere.,46,826,1
Cathie Wood,After gestating for 20-30 years the dream has turned into reality but given the reactions to @ARKInvest's research many investors seem skeptical or reticent. This wall of worry is healthy: I would prefer to invest in the face of fear than exuberance!,161,2018,0
Cathie Wood,The seeds for the explosion in innovation today were planted during the tech and telecom bubble in the late nineties. Back then investors chased the dream before the tech was ready and while costs were too high.,88,1151,1
Cathie Wood,If deflation limits the long term Treasury yield to low single digits the discount factor used to present value future cash flows probably will fall to surprisingly low levels during the next few years a massive head fake in the face of higher inflation expectations.,57,946,0
Cathie Wood,The technologically enabled innovation evolving today is dwarfing that during any other period in history. It is creating ‚Äúgood deflation‚Äù and explosive demand. Battery technology is a good example. In @ARKInvest's view EVs will scale 15-20 fold in the next five years.,106,1260,1
Cathie Wood,GDP statistics evolved during the Industrial Age and do not seem to be keeping up with the digital age. Thanks to productivity real GDP growth probably is higher and inflation lower than reported suggesting that the quality of earnings has increased significantly. https://t.co/7V4dNo3vBL,1108,7312,1

Cathie Wood,The PE on the S&amp;P 500 is likely to adjust to 2-3% nominal GDP growth as disruptive innovation creates ‚Äúcreative destruction‚Äù in the traditional world order.

Cathie Wood,The equity market does not seem ever to have discounted 0.5% 1% 2% or 3% yields on the 10 year Treasury bond.

Cathie Wood,$UBER and $LYFT stayed private too long and lost the plot. They could have incentivized their drivers to put sensors on their cars and collect data much faster than even $TSLA.

Cathie Wood,As first mover Apple still generates the bulk of profits in the smartphone space globally. In our view Tesla could do the same in the #autonomous space certainly in the US and perhaps elsewhere as well.,121,2751,1
Cathie Wood,#Tesla dropped $NVDA not because its GPUs missed the move toward #autonomous but because the design cycle of $GM $BMW &amp; #TM was 4-5 years longer than that for Tesla. Catering to large auto manufacturers Nvidia was not moving fast enough for Tesla.,118,2187,0

Cathie Wood,Erin go Bragh! https://t.co/KM0rYt1CCR,1,159,0
Cathie Wood,Passive investing is unlikely to keep pace with the exponential growth of the five innovation platforms and 14 technologies evolving today. In our view S&amp;P is depriving benchmark-sensitive investors of some of the most important investment opportunities in the world like $TSLA.,119,1029,1
Cathie Wood,Passive and benchmark-sensitive investing is contributing to the most massive misallocation of capital in history. Investing in companies because of their past successes risks putting the US at a serious competitive disadvantage to countries like China.,66,659,1
Cathie Wood,The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are populating their benchmarks increasingly with the ‚Äúvalue traps‚Äù created by innovation stocks that are cheap for a reason. Innovation is disintermediating and/or disrupting the biggest companies in traditional benchmarks.,18,231,0

Cathie Wood,@elonmusk Ah yes. Thanks for flagging. I meant the $25000 car which some are calling the Model 2 as shown in our ARK Disrupt Weekly Newsletter this morning. https://t.co/uh76avGNvt https://t.co/pxqNjEz0nk,44,861,1
Cathie Wood,The auto industry has not enjoyed exponential growth in roughly 100 years. EVs have entered exponential growth territory that will last for the next five to ten years.,208,2051,1
Cathie Wood,According to @skorusARK's battery research #EV sales will scale nearly 20-fold from roughly 1.8 million last year to 35 million 40% of total global auto sales during the next five to six years.,193,1890,0
Cathie Wood,Analysts following $TSLA should be expert in energy storage robotics artificial intelligence and software-as-service. While they are expert at the internal combustion engine traditional auto analysts are not equipped to analyze EVs particularly $TSLA.,193,1865,0
Cathie Wood,According to Wright's Law for every cumulative doubling in the number of EVs produced costs will drop by 28% suggesting that EV prices will drop below those of gas powered vehicles on a like-for-like basis during the next two years.,119,1411,0
Cathie Wood,Traditional auto analysts are analyzing a mature industry in which lower prices signal trouble: higher inventories and lower sales. Led by #Tesla electric vehicles (EVs) are in their infancy and BECAUSE of lower costs and prices are moving into exponential growth trajectory.,110,1464,1
Cathie Wood,Predictably when @elonmusk announced at Battery Day last week that $TSLA would cut the price of a Model 3 to $25000 several financial analysts panicked downgrading the stock and/or cutting their price targets. In our view traditional financial analysts have missed the mark.,892,10745,1
Cathie Wood,As @sbarnettARK elucidates in this extensive tweet thread $ILMN - with 85-90% share of the DNA sequencing market - is entering a crowded molecular diagnostic testing market and will be competing with its customers a questionable strategy. https://t.co/wpUflBCqhz,13,179,1
Cathie Wood,With my apology to $GS which was not monitoring the order book before it filled. That said I do believe that our $GS sales trading contact with whom we interacted many times for updates should have explained the difference between Dutch and Unified auctions. Lessons learned.,1,153,0
Cathie Wood,I stand corrected: $U did a Unified auction not a Dutch auction something completely new to me. With thanks both to my compliance team and to a long time professional friend Lise Buyer Partner at Class V Group LLC for steering me correctly. https://t.co/8jpEzm7zBt,12,266,1
Cathie Wood,Didn't $ILMN take its ownership of  #GRAIL down from 100% to 14% at a much lower valuation to avoid competing with its customers? https://t.co/hDnjDtgUYV,11,131,0
Cathie Wood,.@GrousARK has done some of the most provocative and differentiated research on #gaming in the financial services industry. We are excited to share our forthcoming blogs and white papers during the next few months.,10,198,1
Cathie Wood,I am sure that $GS disclosed this twist in many documents but it never apprised us despite discussions with its sales traders of our clear desire to gain exposure to $U. Did $GS's highest revenue generating customers get the word? I don't want to be in that club. Just wondering.,6,153,0
Cathie Wood,Apparently $GS introduced a Dutch auction twist that did not require it to inform those who had committed to a price above the ‚Äúrange‚Äù that the range had changed unless the ‚Äúindicated price range‚Äù had increased by 20%+. Excuse me?,4,112,0
Cathie Wood,Some of us who placed bids above the initial 40-44 indicated range and then raised our bids above the revised 44-48 range assuming that our bids would be filled learned the hard way that we would receive nothing. Very few things surprise me in this business but this one did.,3,98,1
Cathie Wood,Equity Dutch auctions were designed to democratize initial public offerings. In 2014 I founded @ARKInvest to help democratize investing in the innovation space. Despite best intentions this week $U went public in a Dutch auction sponsored by $GS that we believe missed the mark.,54,609,0
Cathie Wood,According to @skorusARK research other companies focused on EVs are three to four years behind $TSLA in battery technology already. The question is whether these breakthroughs will help #Tesla pull away even faster.,48,630,0
Cathie Wood,Are they more fundamental breakthroughs? Would a 90%+ decline in each of the three important variables - assembly line labor costs cell cost saving per unit of energy and factory floor space - change the slope of the line accelerating the decline in costs from 18%?,23,382,0
Cathie Wood,Thank you for this detailed and thoughtful analysis! @ARKInvest is debating whether these advancements will keep Tesla on pace with Wright's Law: an 18% decline in the cost of EV's battery pack systems for every cumulative doubling in EV demand or https://t.co/8CrcWqZJqV,139,1094,1

Cathie Wood,#SaaS 1.0 and SaaS 2.0 are not mutually exclusive. SaaS 2.0 as in $TWLO and $WORK is more viral: users sell the services to each other.

Cathie Wood,Software is eating the world:$CRM is replacing $XOM in the Dow Jones Industrial Average! #Salesforce's market cap had to scale to $200 billion before attracting the attention of this index. $CRM has been amazing but it's SaaS 1.0 which now is giving way to a more viral SaaS 2.0.,178,1321,1

Cathie Wood,.@ARKInvest has centered its research on Wright's Law.

Cathie Wood,#2U is heading in the same direction and starting to lower prices (check out its Simmons U nursing program). Yes higher education is facing massive disruption.

Cathie Wood,Indeed @TashaARK @skorusARK @wintonARK! https://t.co/jIsRtOZWC7,18,300,1
Cathie Wood,A great reason @jablamsky! Technologically enabled innovation follows declining cost curves and prices that enable exponential growth opportunities for mass markets. Stay on the right side of change! https://t.co/hoJ7BLDav6,16,259,1
Cathie Wood,If successful which we believe will be the case a $TSLA ride-hailing service will lower the probability of our bear case substantially during the next five years bolstering our base case at ~$7000. We are encouraged that few analysts are modeling this possibility! https://t.co/qMqd8TOSbH,274,1746,1
Cathie Wood,Now that $TSLA has 80% and 23% share of the US and Chinese #EV markets respectively and has been profitable for the last 4 quarters it is likely to join the ‚Äúbig leagues‚Äù the indexes. Oh and it is up roughly 5-fold since it troughed in March to more than $250B in market cap.,124,1132,1
Cathie Wood,Exactly. Passive/benchmark-sensitive investors have been protecting $INTC from reality for the last ten years buying it only because it is one of the large tech positions in benchmarks enabling it to rest on its laurels even though Moore's Law had hit a wall. https://t.co/zP2mWL2TyQ,50,461,1

Cathie Wood,@jonnajarian Hi Jon - We'd love to do so! Thanks - Cathie,2,34,1
Cathie Wood,Oil demand probably hit a secular peak last year and thanks to #EVs now is in secular ‚Äúdecline‚Äù. Though ARK has no formal forecast I believe that #Oilprices are on their way back to $12 the level reached after the 1973 oil cartel crisis or lower now that EVs are taking off.,179,879,0
Cathie Wood,.@ARKInvest believes that the oil price peaked at more than $135 per barrel in 2008 and has been hitting ‚Äúlower highs‚Äù and ‚Äúlower lows‚Äù as demand ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù has disappointed expectations for the last 12 years.,18,218,1
Cathie Wood,Yes a 10% drop in US VMT is a big deal. #Oilpricesare determined at the margin. A 1% drop in demand has a significant impact so the impact of a 10% drop in one year is huge. https://t.co/goePAriQ3p,16,301,1

Cathie Wood,Three years ago ARK's forecast for EV sales in 2022 looked ridiculous at 17 million. Our forecast has not changed.  The EIA's forecast for 2022 has gone up &gt;10-fold to roughly 3.5 million and if Wright's Law is correct it will have to increase its forecast another 5-fold.,27,238,1
Cathie Wood,Wright's Law also has helped us forecast how quickly the demand for #EVs would scale. Three years ago the EIA and other forecasting agencies were expecting 200-300000 EV sales in 2022. Last year global EV sales were 1.45 million. https://t.co/MsVJ7NVAZq,55,324,1

Utility‚Ä¶",11,78,0
Cathie Wood,Back to the future?  Yes!,16,213,1
Cathie Wood,During the 50 years ended 1929 electricity telephony and the internal combustion combined to turbocharge unit growth and lower inflation.  The yield curve was inverted more than half of the time back then with the steepest inversions during periods with the strongest growth.,10,174,0
Cathie Wood,The yield curve is giving us clues that after more than one hundred years truly disruptive innovation and exponential growth have returned. Technologically enabled ‚Äúgood deflation‚Äù should increase broad based purchasing power and turbochargers volume growth.,10,115,1
Cathie Wood,Our bull case assumes that #Tesla loses one-third of its 17% global EV market share during the next five years and that its autonomous strategy succeeds in which case our five- year price target is $4000-$6000.,17,180,1
Cathie Wood,In an attempt to remain conservative our bear case assumes that $TSLA loses two-thirds of its 17% global EV market share during the next five years and that its autonomous strategy fails in which case our five-year price target is $560.,8,114,0
Cathie Wood,Based on Wright's Law our models suggest that global #EV sales will increase nearly 20-fold during the next five years from roughly 1.4 million last year to 26 million in 2023. $TSLA should capture a significant share of the market.,21,141,0
Cathie Wood,The last wave of innovation - exponential growth - was not the #Internet.  It was electricity telephony and the ICE in the late 1800's/early 1900's. Our shift from R&amp;D to PP&amp;E reflects a more aggressive pivot from trucks and utility storage to EVs based on recent EV demand.,8,95,1
Cathie Wood,Because the investment world has been built on the linear growth industries that have evolved in post WWII experience $TSLA's exponential growth strategy seems out of place if not impossible. Post WWII does not incorporate the last great wave of innovation.,5,111,0
Cathie Wood,This week @elonmusk highlighted in an internal email that #Tesla's second quarter deliveries could surpass those in the fourth quarter breaking another record.  If so $TSLA should shift R&amp;D dollars to #EV capex to pull even further ahead on its autonomous vehicle strategy.,6,93,0
Cathie Wood,The shift in our model from spending from R&amp;D to PP&amp;E during the next five years is based on the demand metrics for #Tesla's EVs that are surfacing around the world Check out not only the US but also Norway which the bears wrote off after subsidies lapsed last year.,8,92,1
Cathie Wood,Based on #Tesla's stunning results year-over-year in the first quarter relative to the $GM Bolt - the Model 3 sales up 6-fold from a base more than 50% higher than the Bolt's while the Bolt's sales were flat - $TSLA should go full throttle in EV production.,10,126,0
Cathie Wood,Negative responses to our open-source $TSLA model focus on changes we made to PP&amp;E and R&amp;D while maintaining our price targets.  Those responses highlight the short term time horizon of analysts in the public markets and their unwillingness/inability to model exponential growth. https://t.co/wFTUHprO9t,67,540,1
Cathie Wood,Interestingly on Friday $TSLA hit its 100 month moving average roughly the same place that $AMZN hit before beginning its eight year climb from 35 to 2000. Perhaps the HFTs and algorithms that dominate trading these days will take note. We shall see.,79,502,1
Cathie Wood,As the record shows$TSLA has contributed positively to the performance of our strategies since inception. Importantly we have traded it aggressively in the 141-387 trading range in place since our inception in 2004 while maintaining it as our first or second largest position.,7,179,1
Cathie Wood,Led by our DoR @wintonARK our analysts - @TashaARK @skorusARK and @jwangARK - are contributing important research to the investment community. Our $TSLA model and assumptions are on GitHub. We are grateful for the contributions others are making to make it more robust.,4,92,0
Cathie Wood,Centered on Wright's Law our first principles research is the reason for my conviction that $TSLA is as profound an investment opportunity today as was $AMZN 10-15 years ago.,12,145,1
Cathie Wood,Now that its success is obvious in hindsight most sell-side analysts remember that I bucked conventional wisdom and applauded the fact that Amazon was investing aggressively to capitalize on the inevitable shift to e-commerce and #AWS at the expense of short-term profits.,4,113,0
Cathie Wood,$TSLA during the past five years reminds me of $AMZN from 2004-2009. Investors/speculators laughed at worst or were baffled as we bought the stock when it tanked into the 20's and 30's in a 25-120 trading range. Trading recently at $2000 #Amazon is one of my best stocks ever.,41,247,1
Cathie Wood,Thank you Eric for pointing out how many stocks are doing so well for us!  Interestingly no one said anything on Twitter last year when $TSLA was up roughly 50% from its low and 25% in the fourth quarter. #Tesla was a great diversifier when other stocks were getting crushed. https://t.co/Y1P22Fe3N6,25,336,1
Cathie Wood,.@ARKInvest analyst @mfriedrichARK is researching and surfacing not only the significant gap in valuations between the public and private markets but also the beneficial rights that late stage venture investors are extracting to get these deals done at such high valuations.,12,82,1
Cathie Wood,I am surprised that large asset managers like #Fidelity and $TROW that are participating in both the public and private markets aren't arbitraging this significant gap in valuations. Don't their private and public equity teams compare notes.  Don't they talk to one another?,3,75,0
Cathie Wood,The valuation gaps between companies focused on the same kind of innovation in the private markets vs. public markets can be stunning: Formlabs at 10X revenues vs. #Stratsyss at 2x is a good example.,3,18,1
Cathie Wood,Large public market asset managers contributed to this void as they have tried to capture more ‚Äúalpha‚Äù by moving funds from the public equity markets to the pre IPO markets during the past five to ten years.,2,14,0
Cathie Wood,Because of late stage #VC funding #innovation in the private markets is incredibly overvalued.  In the public markets innovation is undervalued a void created partly by backward-looking passive and benchmark-sensitive strategies. https://t.co/sIg8ZU7aZY,26,168,0
Cathie Wood,Ah we forgot to mention in our analysis of batteries artificial intelligence robots and autonomous systems that as it disrupts most other traditional #auto companies $TSLA is an #EV company morphing into a transportation-as-a-service (think SaaS) company. https://t.co/VVd95C9bjs,57,363,1
Cathie Wood,Wrights's Law is a relative of Moore's Law Wright's Law a function of units and Moore's Law a function of time.  Units work better than time in technological enabled innovation.,10,60,1

Cathie Wood,Also interesting to note Jonas cut his worst case price by more than 90% but left his price target unchanged at $230. So I guess he is suggesting that the probability of the bear case has dropped significantly and/ or the probability of the bull case has increased. https://t.co/Digxee8IOn,63,433,0
Cathie Wood,I'd be much more concerned about the demand for gas powered cars.  I'm puzzled over Adam Jonas's ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù rating on $GM because the #Bolt's sales are flat year over year and its gas powered car sales are falling.  Gas powered car sales seem to have peaked globally.,58,404,0
Cathie Wood,Increasingly when #UBER drivers drop me off at the train they ask about the economics of the #Model3. Demand for the Model 3 extends well beyond the premium sedan market.,19,276,0
Cathie Wood,As the average price of an EV moves toward and drops below that of gas powered cars in the next few years EV demand growth should transition from strong to explosive.,17,172,1
Cathie Wood,Based on original research (which seems rare on the Street these days) the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a $TSLA's Model 3 is lower than that of the average gas powered vehicle as shown in ARK's Sunday newsletter above.,19,184,1
Cathie Wood,.@ARKInvest would like to compare notes with Adam Jonas and his team at Morgan Stanley on their concern about EV demand. The concern should be about gas-powered cars. EVs are growing nicely. https://t.co/EyG8BYEe81,134,678,0
Cathie Wood,By our estimates $GM #Bolt sales were flat on a year-over-over basis at roughly 5000 in Q1 while $TSLA Model 3 sales were up more than six-fold from roughly 8200 to 50000.,63,428,0
Cathie Wood,Many analysts and investors seem to be confusing #auto sales with #EV sales. EVs are rising and taking share in both the US and China the two largest markets. Sales of gas-powered cars seem to have peaked globally. https://t.co/ygvMwb57uY,95,430,1
