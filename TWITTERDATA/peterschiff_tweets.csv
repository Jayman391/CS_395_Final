In reality the only possible way to avoid a complete economic meltdown is not to raise the debt ceiling.

Second he's wrong to think that following that victory the Fed will lower rates back to the ultra-low levels that existed after the 2008 financial crisis.,https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1606393379826319366,Twitter Web App,New,35,431

2034,15/07/2022 23:34:49,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,There's no way to bring #inflation down without a severe #recession and a financial crisis. Laffer is correct that we need much higher interest rates. But that will prick America's bubble economy. We can't afford tax cuts. What must be cut are regulations and government spending.,https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1548088727037042688,Twitter Web App,Reply (native),82,710
2035,15/07/2022 23:27:18,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,Art Laffer still doesn't get it. He thinks #inflation can easily be cured without a #recession by letting interest rates rise above the inflation rate and cutting taxes. Rates that high would not only cause a massive recession but a financial crises. Tax cuts increase deficits.,https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1548086836509097984,Twitter Web App,New,75,843

2923,12/04/2022 20:52:01,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,It looks like #Bitcoin couldn't hold $40K after all. Too bad @CNBC. HODLers had better hope for better luck at $30K otherwise it's a long way down. #Coinbase making a new all-time low and closing below $150 per share is not a good sign for the future of #crypto.

2924,12/04/2022 20:12:06,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,YoY core #CPI makes no sense. The reason economists look at monthly core and not the headline number is to smooth out short-term volatility in monthly changes. But if food &amp; energy prices rise YoY it's not volatility it's a trend. So YoY the headline number is all that matters!,https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1513973254310006785,Twitter Web App,New,35,302
2925,12/04/2022 19:40:56,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,If #inflation is Putin's fault why is core CPI up? A 6.5% rise is still more than triple the Fed's 2% target and has nothing to do with #Putin. With people spending more on food &amp; energy they should have less to spend on other goods sending those prices lower.

2929,12/04/2022 14:17:46,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,Markets are pricing in #Fed rate hikes peaking at 3.25% in 2023. But since official #inflation will be above 4% throughout the end of 2023 negative rates will be ineffective in fighting inflation. Plus long before 3.25% is reached recession will result in rate cuts and more QE!,https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1513884081083277312,Twitter Web App,New,48,414
2930,12/04/2022 13:45:03,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,The 8.5% YoY gain in March #CPI is the highest since 1981 when interest rates were 20% &amp; CPI was 13.5%. Current interest rates are .25% and using the 1981 CPI the YoY gain is likely 17%.

2931,12/04/2022 13:01:06,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,Investors are relieved that the 1.2% jump in the March #CPI or the 8.5% YoY surge the biggest gain in forty years wasn't worse. The actual rate is likely 17%! They are also taking false comfort in the less than expected .3% monthly and 6.5% YoY rise excluding food and energy.,https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1513864789835104257,Twitter Web App,New,118,782

2933,12/04/2022 12:08:29,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,The #Bitcoin coverage on @CNBC is so biased due to their crypto advertisers and parade of industry shills that today's coverage is focused on the meaningless fact that Bitcoin has recovered back above $40K rather than its 16% drop over the past two weeks or its 38% YoY plunge!,https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1513851548400562182,Twitter Web App,New,55,609

2935,11/04/2022 22:47:49,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,Those who claimed QE wouldn't cause #inflation were right. QE doesn't cause inflation QE is inflation. But QE does cause prices to rise. It's just that there can be a long lag between QE and big price increases. That's why so many still don't make the connection between the two!,https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1513650053902184448,Twitter Web App,New,94,782
2936,11/04/2022 21:38:06,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,@elonmusk @LPofMN The government is the winner as it spends the newly printed money into circulation.

2938,11/04/2022 19:33:27,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,To clarify this Tweet a 2.5% interest rate is only stimulative for #inflation. It's not stimulative for the U.S. economy as it's so over-leveraged with debt that though 2.5% would be stimulative for a healthy economy it's not stimulative enough for our sick economy.

2939,11/04/2022 18:46:16,@PeterSchiff,Peter Schiff,The #Fed claims it will fight #inflation by raising interest rates to a neutral rate of 2.25% - 2.5% by year-end. But you can't fight inflation by being neutral. It requires tight money. Plus 2.5% is not a neutral interest rate with an 8% inflation rate. It's highly stimulative!,https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1513589265917227009,Twitter Web App,New,113,781
