Bonds are determining stocks so why SHOULD stocks bounce if bonds haven't?,0

the absurdity of this rally in Bed Bath  $BBBY is palpable.. At this pace the entire share count--117 million shares--will have traded...,1
Peltz got 45 minutes with Disney!!,0
We will now be talking Disney with Peltz !!,1
Here we go PELTZ,0
So what should Bed Bath do? Pretty simple: get in shape to offer 100 million shares on a spot sale. Otherwise own up and declare,1
You had to figure that they would guide down for this q but they were surprisingly bullish for the second half ($TSM) a great test for how $AMD and $NVDA will act today... ex CPI,1
Taiwan Semi is a most amazing company to be doing this well. Gross margins are fantastic and business is growing much faster than so many semis. Just a gem that MUST be protected from harm....,1
Jay Powell has to be happy about those KB Homes numbers: tons of chatter about big home price cuts from competitors and lower costs per home!!,1
Rough ride for those who sold this stock after that CNBC interview...but need to be a little more cautious when someone is that downbeat https://t.co/iXNs8BYXYL,0

Britain looks like it is sending battle tanks to Ukraine. Why can't we send them the 600 by Aerovironment  (AVAV)  in large quantities enough to destroy whole mechanized divisions. They can be produced quickly and are much more effective than Lockheed's Javelin,0

They will continue to purge high multiple stocks and crypto in all of its derivatives will continue to be hammered as long as the fed stays tight or gets tighter,1
I think Binance can still succeed in buying Voyager but i also believe you don't want the SEC fighting you right now...,1
SEC not letting Binance close the Voyager deal.. i think the SEC is VERY worried that Binance will prove to be more chimerical than we think. I reiterate i do nit like crypto and its defenders are too strident about its need... I just don't want people to lose money needlessly,1
Amazon has 1.5 million people working for it. 17000 people even people in HQ is not enough. These tech companies must bite the bullet,0

The Journal reports that the believers in Bed Bath are still holding strong despite Cohen's exit. I guess it doesn't bother them that even after he put three people on the board he wouldn't stick around? How can that mean nothing to these people?,0

"In one 24 hour period it went from ""In Ryan Cohen we trust to In Ryan Cohen we bust."" The Apes find great solace in hating me but i think tonight you realize that it is misdirected albeit enjoyable while (if) you have the money to make it last",1

I will say this about Primatologist-in-chief Ryan Cohen: he has ridden a wave of Jane Goodall's finest all the way to the bank and is a lot smarter than Bed Bath which should have bailed before him.. Ryan please come on Mad Money tomorrow and tell us how you did it!!,1

$BBBY 65 million shares and 390 million shares traded. Is this mindless manipulation to break the shorts?  I think the company's viability is in question but it has the ultimate opportunity to sell stock at least with an ATM.. How can they be so obtuse?,1
Maybe Gove figured out that BBBY is up because of the squeeze NOT the merch and will sell 20 million shares.,0
I often find CEOs are obtuse to the stock market. So i will explain it real easy:  Bed Bath needs money. It can raise money at a price higher than where it sold a lot of stock Now is the time. Sell or die.,1
Memo to Sue Gove Bed Bath &amp; Beyond CEO. You must know your balance sheet is so weak that you run the risk of not getting seasonal inventory. You should be fired if you don't offer equity right here to solve your problems and give you time.,1

Short sellers in so many of these small caps are getting crushed now. It's not just BBBY Meanwhile the ceo of Bed Bath says nothing!,0
How is it possible after GameStop that short sellers didn't take profits in Bed Bath? Didn't anyone notice that almost half of the float is sold short? How can they do such a stupid thing? They need an equity offering or a default or they might be boxed,0

I want to make it clear i love and respect the real apes and i value their opinion because of their creative names and their really funny emogies. I had Jane Goodall on for you...Gamestop should take your questions... .,1
Hey Apes the Gamestop quarterly call--they do those after they report--is an exercise in how they raised money off your backs and keep losing it Remaining apes-- cause you are now on the endangered list-- it's a big cash outflow... Thank heavens for you guys it would be kaput,1
My ape friends: lots of really trenchant questions on that Gamestop conference call don't you think? If only stupid emojis could talk would they ask about gross margins? Sales and marketing? TAM ?,0
Early futures which have been wrong for ages signaling down. I think that we are in a persistent existential crisis about this war wanting to crush Russia but fearing just like in 1960 with the missile gap that Putin would use nukes rather than lose,0

Waters also asked Powell to discuss the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling but failed to ask him to discuss the far more drastic consequences of continuing to raise the debt ceiling.,1
Clueless @RepMaxineWaters thinks the biggest threat to the U.S. economy is failing to raise the #DebtCeiling. In reality the only possible way to avoid a complete economic meltdown is not to raise the debt ceiling. The threat to the economy comes from the debt not the ceiling! https://t.co/lAkToycyo3,0
Jerome Powell Performs Open-Mouth Operations; Markets Tank @schiffgold https://t.co/0glY8Ualti,0
@TacosTriggers1 That's because so many other people continue to get it wrong.,1
First #Powell said #inflation was too low. After it rose he said it wasn't a problem. When it became a problem he said it was transitory. Then he cited disinflation as evidence the problem was being solved. Powell got everything wrong. He will never hit his 2% inflation target.,0
Solar Energy Production Could Require Most of the Global Silver Reserves by 2050 @schiffgold https://t.co/ZB8xKZyXym,0
@WhaleChart @SECGov Good start.  Now how about deleting your Twitter account too.,0
@TheBabylonBee No point the treasury is empty.  Better for the U.S. mint to just give him one of their printing presses or ask the Fed to set him up with his own account.,0
#Powell said that we're only just learning about the risks of #crypto and that we need more regulation to protect consumers. The many risks have been obvious from the beginning and the biggest risk of all is that crypto has no value and no amount of regulation will change that.,0
There's no benefit to having a racially diverse FOMC. Growing up hispanic shouldn't impact monetary policy decisions made by hispanic members. The interest's of hispanics will not be better served by having one of their own on the FOMC. The FOMC needs Austrians not hispanics!,0
#Powell claims that the level of the National Debt is sustainable but that it's on a path toward becoming unsustainable in the future. Powell knows the debt is already unsustainable that's why the #Fed has kept interest rates so low for so long and created so much #inflation.,1
#Powell was wrong to claim that the value of the dollar is a concern of the Treasury and not the #Fed. If the Fed wants to bring #inflation down to 2% the exchange rate of the dollar is extremely important. A weaker dollar will put significant upward pressure on consumer prices.,0
It's hypocrisy for @SenWarren to scold #Powell for raising interest rates to fight #inflation causing millions to lose jobs and creating a #recession when its the policies she supports that created that inflation and are destroying the purchasing power of worker's paychecks.,1
#Powell is reluctant to admit Federal deficit spending undermines his efforts to fight #inflation. He thinks telling the truth about fiscal policy mistakes violates the Fed's independence. No but failing to offer an honest opinion defeats the purpose of Congressional hearings.,0
#Powell was wrong when he told #Congress that he has the tools to bring #inflation down to 2%. Without significant cuts to government spending and a willingness to allow a financial crisis to run its natural course the #Fed has no tools its willing to use that will do the job.,0
#Fed Chair #Powell just admitted that #inflation is causing significant economic hardship for Americans. Since the sole cause of inflation is the combination of fiscal and monetary policy it's the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government that are responsible for that hardship. https://t.co/9cKphPTFkx,1

ABC's @4corners claims it investigated the @perthmint yet I know first hand that almost everything they accused my bank of doing is a lie. Therefore their investigation of the Perth Mint has no credibility. Someone needs to investigate @AngusGrigg. He's a fraud and a hypocrite.,0
@PepsiCanJohnny We didn't risk deposit by loaning them out and we provided a lot of valuable banking services at reasonable prices.,0
@PepsiCanJohnny @4corners My bank never defaulted on anything and I never panicked.  I just point out lies that the media tells.,0
@ChrisTayeh @4corners @nytimes We were a 100% reserve bank.  But the bank did inadvertently dip into customer funds so that our reserves were temporarily less than 100% but when the software error was discovered it was fixed and I added extra capital to the bank to cover the reserve shortfall.,0
Peter Schiff: All Roads Lead to Hard Landing and Higher Inflation @schiffgold https://t.co/somRyy9ZVb,0
ABC's @4corners falsely accused my bank of branding itself to be the solution to tax problems. This is not true. No part of my bank's branding included solutions to tax problems and there was no mention of solving tax problems on its website or any other marketing material.,0
ABC @60Mins accused my bank of helping Americans evade their taxes. That's a lie because as a matter of policy my bank didn't accept accounts from U.S. citizens or residents. If this really was the case surely a two-year IRS criminal investigation would have found some evidence.,0
ABC @4corners repeated the lie first told by @60Mins that I moved my bank to Puerto Rico in 2017 to make it easier for the bank's customers to hide their identities. That's false and in my defamation lawsuit Nine has not produced a shred of evidence to support this accusation.,0
@X11145282 @AngusGrigg @perthmint Do you think that includes all of my employees and all the other people I do business with?,1
ABC's @AngusGrigg claims my bank effected a $25 million bulk transfer to the @perthmint to hide the beneficial owners. No transaction anywhere near that size ever took place and my bank never did anything to intentionally hide the identity of any of its customers from the mint.,0
ABC's @4corners deliberately mislead its audience by claiming my bank is currently under investigation for money laundering and tax evasion. They failed to inform their audience that the investigation ended over a year ago without finding any evidence the bank facilitated either. https://t.co/bIOamE4aQA,0
By the way my bank only had about 100 Australian customers and the average account balance was around $30K. Maybe the Australian media should try looking into actual criminal activity and real threats to Australia instead of just making up fake threats coming from my small bank.,0
@K72576206 I can't get millions unless I prove that the false allegations actually caused me to lose millions. The defamation by 60 Minutes Australia did cause me to lose millions so I am suing them. I need to wait and see what happens with ABC.,0
Serious question are there any honest journalists in Australia? If so feel free to reach out to me to write the real story about my bank and expose the lies dishonest journalists and corrupt politicians have been telling about it and the harm they've done to innocent customers.,0
@Economicpop101 @AngusGrigg @perthmint Novo bank will not accept my moral authority to send out the wires.,1
@Aggie647 @AngusGrigg @perthmint Yes it will be fun tearing this fiction passed off as journalism apart.,1
It's too bad @AngusGrigg didn't actually do any research before making false allegations about my bank. Bank customer who held #gold that the bank stored with the @perthmint had no ability to transfer any of that gold to third parties nor could they take delivery of the metal.,0
"@SouvikG40928403 @AngusGrigg @perthmint Ask him.  Lying about me seems to be something Australian ""journalists"" like to do.",0
@Economicpop101 @AngusGrigg @perthmint I wish I could.  But I have no legal authority or ability to do that.,0
ABC's @AngusGrigg is lying about my bank. He claims customers used my bank to target the @perthmint to evade taxes. That's impossible. Bank customers had a choice of keeping their deposits in multiple currencies or #gold. Choosing gold didn't make their accounts any more private. https://t.co/ZLSqzNr3Xz,0
@Open_Mind_Heart @4corners Yes I can't say for 100% certain that not a single one of the bank's customers past or present was ever convicted of tax evasion. But I can say that I am not aware of any and neither is anyone else who worked at the bank.,0
@SuperCycleBear @4corners @perthmint That the bank hid customer identities from the Perth Mint and that hundreds if not thousands of its customers are illegally evading taxes. They can't even name one.,0
@Bulldozer0 @marioparker2 @4corners That saying would't hold up in court.,0
@Bulldozer0 @4corners Not that simple. It costs lots of money and I also have to prove I was financially damaged by the lie. I could sue but it might not be a wise investment to do so. But I'm considering my options.,0
@theREALDjTJ @4corners @perthmint Exactly. Ex-cons have as much right to own gold as anyone else. Maybe 4 Corners believes grocery stores should refuse to sell ex-cons food.,1
@LeandroMantovam @4corners @perthmint No but hopefully soon.,0
According to @4corners an ex-con walked into the @perthmint to buy $27K worth of physical #gold because he wanted to use the gold to evade taxes. If tax evasion was really his goal he would have left his money in cash. The only tax he likely want to legally avoid was #inflation.,0
According to @4corners it should be illegal for anyone with a criminal record to buy #gold. They've condemned the @perthmint for selling an ex-con 27K worth of physical gold. They don't just want to disarm Australians they want to leave them defenseless against #inflation too. https://t.co/xVljQjiu0W,1
@marioparker2 @4corners First even if my father committed a crime it doesn't mean that I'm also guilty of committing the same crime just by association. You don't visit the crimes of fathers on the sons. Didn't anyone ever tell you that.,1
@rhcp_steve @4corners @perthmint All bank's have omnibus accounts and not just for metals but for currency deposits as well. Brokerage firms have omnibus accounts for their customers too. If you by IBM in your brokerage account IBM has no idea who you are.,0
According to @4corners over 2K customers of my bank are tax evaders about 1/3 of the customer base. Yet to my knowledge none have been convicted of tax evasion. Also my bank was the target of the largest global tax evasion investigation in history yet no employee was charged. https://t.co/vCXcF2Dces,0
@winfordwnt @4corners4 But they have no actually evidence that any bank customer committed tax evasion let alone thousands.,0
@adnanalamoudi @4corners @perthmint Checking with my lawyer now. Its expensive to sue that's the problem.,0
@4corners @perthmint Everyone should report the ABC 4 Corners tweet as misleading. They won't even allow comments. That says it all.,1
@herpaderping @4corners @perthmint @elonmusk I don't know. Maybe I can complain to Twitter. I'll try. I wonder if any news organization in Australia are legitimate.,0
Australia's @4corners just published lies about my bank. They allege that thousands of customers used the bank to illegally evade taxes and that the bank deliberately kept customer's identities secret from the @perthmint. Both allegations are demonstrably false. More fake news!,0

The problem is that the #Fed can't raise rates high enough to get #inflation back down to 2% without creating a worse financial crisis than the one it created in 2008. So the Fed will surrender long before inflation returns to 2% (which would actually be 4% using the 1980s CPI).,0
It took the #Fed until 1986 to get the high #inflation rates of the 1970s down to 2% (a benchmark that wasn't achieved again until 1998 12 years later.) The Fed Funds rate hit a high of 16.2% in 1986. Today's Fed Funds rate is 4.6%. Interest rates still have a long way to rise!,1

The more money the government spends on education the less educated the nation becomes. Today's college grads know less than high school grads once knew and today's high school grads know less than what elementary school grads once knew. We need education not more government.,1
Instead of trying to save families hundreds of dollars per year on airfare credit cards hotel fees cells phones etc which are none of the government's business how about cutting government spending and saving families thousands of dollars per year in income taxes.,0
Just because Republicans were wrong to have supported Trump's deficits doesn't mean they should make that mistake with Biden's deficits. Republicans needs to learn from their mistakes and refuse to raise the #DebtCeiling again. Let's pay our bills instead of running up more debt.,0
The way to grow wealth isn't by taxing the investment capital of corporations or billionairs who would have invested that money productively to increase the economic output of the U.S and then transferring it to the Federal Government which will waste it on consumption.,0
The only way the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce #inflation is if its repealed. The act will result in higher inflation as the deficits generated to fund it reduce output in the private sector and cause the Federal Reserve to ultimately monetize the additional debt.,0
Buy America laws artificially drive up the cost of production make Americans poorer and lower real wages. They also make American industry less competitive as American companies are forced to pay more for components than their foreign competitors.,0
American is already broke from all the money the government borrowed and spent in the past. The last thing the government needs to do is borrow more to overpay for infrastructure. This will crowd out far more productive investments that would have been made by the private sector.,0
America isn't exporting more as trade deficits rose sharply under @POTUS. The government isn't going to create wealth by passing more laws. It will destroy more wealth. The only way government can help individuals create wealth is by cutting spending and repealing regulations.,1
The only reason America has record low unemployment is that the unemployment rate is not being honestly measured. The only reason jobs have been created is that American workers can't make ends meet with just one job so they've been forced to take one or two more.,0

@CryptoSmart8 We did not have a long history of non-compliance. That was an inaccurate statement.  The bank did not even have its first OCIF audit until less than a year from when that statement was made. So even if the bank did have a history of non-compliance it went back less than a year.,0
@DerektheCleric The IRS and 60 Minutes Australia had a lot to do with it.  So no just Puerto Rico.,0

https://t.co/Z71GxLST5d https://t.co/Z71GxLST5d",0
@mrmisterisback @crypto_snapper The IRS had nothing to do with this problem. Most banks loan out 95% of their deposits. So they only keep about 5% cash on hand. My bank only used about 2% of deposits so had about 98% of the cash on hand when the error was caught and corrected with a capital injection by me.,0
@mrmisterisback @crypto_snapper I'm not a programmer so I don't know why the bank's software didn't differentiate between bank and customers funds in our checking account. But once the error was discovered it was fixed and the problem never happened again.,0
@bestes90 I will speak more openly once all customer funds are returned and the bank is finally liquidated. Until then I don't want to risk delaying the process any further. But they can't prove me guilty as they didn't even find evidence to file charges.,0
@mrmisterisback @crypto_snapper The IRS didn't even care about this. The bank found the error on its own and fixed it. No laws were broken.,0
@whoyatoya @MagnusTheRedd He was a former independent contractor who did remote IT work for the bank. He never accused the bank of money laundering or shady dealings. He sent me an email after he was fired claiming that management was not qualified and recommended that I hire more experienced leadership.,1
@crypto_snapper The 60 Minutes defamation caused the bank to lose millions. A software glitch allowed the bank to inadvertently use customer funds to cover losses. Once the error was discovered by the bank the software was fixed and I immediately deposited personal funds to cover the shortfall.,1
@mrmisterisback No there is a reason. It's BS but it's a reason. I wish I could disclose it now but I've been asked by the bank's Portugese attorney not to say anything as it will delay the return of funds even longer.  However once customer funds are returned I will be able to speak freely.,0
@mrmisterisback It's not what I think it's what I know. I was only questioned once by federal authorities for about a half hour over three years ago. Not a word from any of them since.  I was never asked to provide a single personal document.,1
@mrmisterisback The tax evasion investigation concluded with no evidence found to charge anyone. The transfer of customer funds is being held up despite this fact.,0
@BrianVarnerVA There are thousands of customers who care but everyone should care when governments abuse their power and violate the law.,0
@Frankie05252607 I am reviewing legal options for myself and customers.,0
@MagnusTheRedd The only scam related to my bank was the one committed by the media in falsely reporting my guilt and by the IRS or ATO for leaking a confidential investigation to the media prior to discovering the complete innocence of the bank and everyone running it.,1
@mrmisterisback There are no prosecutors. No charges were filed. The investigation ended over a year ago.,0
Inaccurate allegations regarding Euro Pacific Bank posted in an online forum require me to set the record straight. The bank and I believed we fully complied with everything regulators asked us to do and we had no advance warning that the bank was in danger of being shut down.,0

@TajoCrypto There are 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis in the world enough for each person to have several hundred thousand. But since there is nothing anyone can do with a Sat in makes no difference how many one has. Massive supply but no real demand other than temporary demand from speculators.,0
Both #gold and #Bitcoin are up in 2023 but they're rising for opposite reasons. Gold is rising as a hedge against #inflation and a weaker #dollar while Bitcoin is rising with other high-risk assets as speculators bet that a #Fed pivot will cause a rally in 2022s biggest losers.,0

@PeterMcCormack Sure but I also advised people to sell their Bitcoin when it was well over $60K. Yes those who sell now will be better off than those who sold following that particular tweet but those who let this selling opportunity slip by won't. I'm sure you will be amount the latter.,1
@WallStreetSilv @elonmusk @SRSroccoReport I don't see how Elon can be correct.  It's not like the is a huge excess supply of copper being mined.  If demand goes way up due to EVs more supply will have to be brought on stream to prevent prices from soaring.,0

Since my bank was closed for allegedly not having enough capital other Puerto Rico banks also received warnings of capital deficiency and given time to add additional capital or be closed. Why was my bank not given similar notice or the opportunity to raise additional capital?,0
@jpalioto Yes but that trend is likely transitory.,1
"Janet Yellen just said that #inflation has been ""quite moderate for the last six months."" The #CPI rose 1.8% during those six months which annualizes to 3.6%. That's hardly moderate especially given the rise follows an 11% annualized rise in the CPI during the prior six months. https://t.co/vnPPlQMAFh",1
Instead of falling by .9% as expected Dec. import prices rose by .4%. This likely resulted from weakness in the U.S. dollar. Continued dollar weakness in 2023 will only add to the upward pressure #inflation puts on consumer prices. Recent improvements in the #CPI are transitory.,0
@horshack_arnold Prior to the false allegations the bank was fine other than typical covid related losses which the bank was readily able to handle. Also the bank only found out that its capital was insufficient to operate after it was shut down. It wan't given any opportunity to add capital.,0
@horshack_arnold No customer withdrawals resulted from the bank's inability to offer key services as its partners refused to do business with the bank due to the false allegations. Since the bank made no loans those withdrawals didn't impact capital other than creating operating losses.,0

@MasterBit90 @MiIIionheir It's always a bad time to buy Bitcoin or any crypto especially if your goal is to own an inflation hedge.,0
#Inflation is defined not just by an expansion of the money supply but of the credit supply. Despite #Fed rate hikes consumer credit is expanding faster than ever. Consumers have ready access to borrow money to pay higher prices. Easy money is still fueling the inflation fire.,0

"Those betting the #Fed will cut interest rates this year are likely correct but the cuts won't be the result of lower #inflation but higher inflation that puts upward pressure on long-term interest rates and unemployment. The Fed will ease to ""stimulate"" the economy &amp; markets.",0
@cameron @DCGco As I warned at the time buying $GBTC at NAV with a 30% premium was a major contributor to flows into GBTC which help send Bitcoin prices soaring. But as I also predicted once the premium became a discount it would be a major problem. Plus all #crypto related loans are high risk.,0
Blaming #inflation on rising wages is like blaming a fever on the thermometer. Fighting inflation by trying to limit wage gains is like fighting a fever by smashing the thermometer. Targeting symptoms while ignoring the disease only allows patients and economies to get sicker.,0

@TheMerryTrader No if we balance the budget and stop taking on new debt there is no reason to raise the ceiling. Going deeper into debt is not the solution to a debt problem. We need to actually start to pay off the debt we have. That will never happen if the debt ceiling keeps getting raised.,0

The people who know the least about #inflation are the ones currently serving on the FOMC. That's because anyone who actually understands inflation isn't appointed to serve. There is no way the Federal Reserve will solve a problem that it was purposely designed not to understand.,0

Rising wages don't cause #inflation they result from inflation. Putting people out of work will make inflation worse.

@MattGoldstein26 I pointed this out in a debate with Mashinsky over a year ago when I accused him of taking huge risks with customer's deposits. Machinsky claimed he didn't put deposits at risk. But the government and the media waisted their time investigating my innocent bank instead of Celsius.,0
"@NewYorkStateAG @CelsiusNetwork What took you so long?  I call Mashinsky out on his obvious fraud including lying about the high risk over a year ago. Had you been paying attention you could have acted sooner and prevented most of the losses. This video is all the evidence you need.

When full-time workers start losing their side hustles it won't be because they no longer need them but because the #economy will be too weak to support them. In fact in the next leg of this #recession as #inflation spikes many workers will lose their full &amp; part-time #jobs. https://t.co/OL4PJI53MS,0
@firedfiat No the economy is weak and it will remain weak until all the imbalances are purged from the economy interest rates are allowed to rise to a free-market level and federal and state governments make substantial cuts to excessive spending and repeal burdensome regulations.,0
The stronger than expected #ADP jobs report is indicative of a weak not a stong #labor market. In strong labor markets #inflation doesn't force workers who already have full-time jobs to take 2nd or 3rd low-paying part-time jobs to make ends meet. Rate hikes will make it worse.,0
Another shoe has dropped as shares of #crypto bank #SilvergateCapital plunge over 46% to a 52-week low below $12 per share. That's a 95% collapse from its 2021 high. The company will slash its workforce to mitigate losses. More shoes will drop as crypto proves to be a centipede.,1

@CryptoSmart8 @SBF_FTX The Commissioner was mistaken. The bank did not have a long history of non-compliance. In fact the bank didn't even have its first compliance audit until about a year before that was written. Also I was a passive investor in the bank. I was not an officer or employee.,0

@BigBag1987 @saylor To carry forward for future gains just in case Bitcoin goes back up. Maybe Saylor thinks the chance of that happening is slim.,0
Why did @saylor only sell and buy back 704 #Bitcoin to take a $31 million dollar tax loss when $MSTR owns over 130000 Bitcoin with an unrealized loss of over $2 billion? Why not realize the entire loss and carry it forward? Maybe there's not enough real liquidity in the market.,0
@startyman Yes it just takes one motivated seller of a single Sat with no buyers willing to pay more than zero for that Sat to push the price of all Bitcoin to zero.,0
@CryppelCrypto What are you going to do when Bitcoin is back below $3800?,0
@virtualc4t Sell Bitcoin is not investment advice. Its just common sense. Bitcoin is not an investment.,0
@sell9000 I don't think I can buy at zero as my buying would at least push the price up to 1 penny.,0
@Bt_76B On August 15th Bitcoin was at $24K.  It's at $16.5K today over 30% lower. Those who left are better off than those who stayed. They have more money and can chose to buy back their Bitcoin for a lot less. Those who left Bitcoin at higher prices are even better positioned.,1
The results are in. 38.3% of Bitcoin HODLers will jump ship and sell their Bitcoin at lower prices while 61.7% will go down with the ship as it sinks to zero without selling any. The 38% who intend to sell lower should sell now and invest in something else to recover their loss.,0
@SpencerKSchiff If you would sell below 3K its better to just sell now. That way you preserve a lot more money and can invest it someplace else to make back what you lost.,0
@KingGronkeykong It's not the same. Gold is an actual metal with real value. It's price will never go to zero and if it got anywhere near zero you should buy as much as you can until the price goes back up. Bitcoin is all about confidence which is a function of price and momentum.,1
@h_sorted Yes but neither I nor anyone at the bank screwed them. We can't be held responsible for the decisions of regulators. There were lots of options where no customer funds would have been frozen. I tired my best to get regulators to agree to take one of those options. They refused.,0
@crypto_0ptimist The problem is that even if Bitcoin isn't stolen its market price can collapse. So you lose either way.,0
@collectiveresea All deposits are still stuck at the bank. But customers who had funds and securities in the bank's broker dealer subsidiary which never went into receivership have had those accounts transferred into their own names. So a 100% recovery.,0
@io53ph Yes but regulators didn't find any irregularities. However prior to discovering the bank's innocence they illegally leaked the confidential investigation to 60 Minutes Australia that publicly declared my guilt of using the bank to help criminals launder money and evade taxes.,0

@luka_zener @SergioBowers1 No bank employees did that by error due to a software glitch. I was merely a passive investor in the bank at the time. As soon as the bank caught the error I personally replaced the money. The software was fixed and the mistake was never made again. Also the bank never failed.,0

#Gold managed to end 2022 with a slight annual gain of just over 1%. In contrast #Bitcoin aka digital fool's gold is down 64%. But Bitcoin isn't out of the woods yet as it still has another full day of 2022 trading to crash. So its total 2022 loss could end up much greater.,0
The U.S. dollar Index may have had a strong year but it ended the year on a six-month low down 10% from its Nov. high. This weakness will likely continue in 2023 with the dollar having one of its worst years ever. If I'm right the #inflation problem is about to get much worse.,0
Gold ended the year with a 2-day 1% rally closing the year at $1825. In contrast #gold stocks finished the last two days of the year flat. That indicates gold stock traders don't expect gold to begin 2023 as strong as it ended 2022. So look out for a big gold rally next week!,1
@ChimmyC91459045 There is but I am not at liberty to speak freely at this moment. But the entire story is actually much worse for the governments involved and 60 Minutes Australia.,0
@abbottmd Yes we did not loan out any of our deposits so every customer could have withdraw 100% of their account on the same day and the bank would have been able to fulfill the requests.,0
@PopMelancholic Not true. We had no Russian customers. The Australian drug drug trafficker 60 Minutes falsely accused of using my bank only had a suspended sentence 25 years ago and never even funded his bank account. I haven't heard of any Australian customers fined for tax evasion either.,0

@PopMelancholic There is no laundered money at my bank.  No bank was examined more then mine.  Despite a massive investigation unprecedented in scale 6 governments found no evidence of any financial crimes committed by the bank or anyone running it.,0
The worst performing sectors of the #StockMarket in 2022 will likely repeat as the worst performing sectors in 2023. The bubble has popped but valuations remain high. It's the sectors that performed the worst during the bubble that will likely perform best as the air comes out.,0

@floatingpointz There is a big difference between FTX and my bank. I didn't take any of my customer's money for personal use like SBF did. All customer funds are still there unencumbered by liabilities. It's government regulators that are denying customers access to their funds.,0
Six months ago regulators put my bank into receivership to protect customers. Since then not a single bank customer has been able to withdraw any of their money. However without government protection every bank customer could have withdrawn 100% of their deposits six months ago.,0
@woonomic There is a big difference. Online media is a better way to distribute content.  Bitcoin is not a better store of value than gold. Your image is ironically appropriate. Bitcoin is the Titanic. Gold is the iceberg.,0

$ARKK is a perfect example of how not to invest. The ETF was the best performer in 2020 but the worst in 2021 &amp; 2022.

$ARKK is down 81% from its 2021 high and 69% so far in 2022. Yet during this year the fund has enjoyed net inflows of almost $700 million. Imagine what will happen in 2023 if @CathieDWood fans finally throw in the towel. The fund may close and pay redemptions in-kind not cash.,1

@SavageProfits @elonmusk @WallStreetSilv No your brick of gold says in storage. You walk around with tokens that evidence ownership of that brick. Then you can pay for goods and services using those tokens. You don't have to spend the entire brick just whatever fraction is required to cover the purchase price.,0
@CaesarAP4 @elonmusk @WallStreetSilv It has been done but not by Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not tokenized gold it's tokenized nothing.,0
@elonmusk @WallStreetSilv That's another reason why its so important that the private sector use blockchain technology to tokenize the ownership of gold and silver so that the people have an alternative to government issued fiat as a medium of exchange.,0
@mcuban @WallStreetSilv @lordnabi Your question relates to gold speculators who've sold gold they don't own and don't expect to deliver. If all longs decide to take delivery the price of gold would soar and its unlikely exchanges would be able to guarantee delivery. So buy actual gold not a futures contract.,0

I think @HowardMarksBook is wrong twice. First he's wrong to forecast the #Fed will succeed in reducing #inflation to 2%. Second he's wrong to think that following that victory the Fed will lower rates back to the ultra-low levels that existed after the 2008 financial crisis.,0
@BetterLifeLab @VShabo @CNNOpinion It's not a failure of the free market but the government's failure to allow the market to be free. If you want American families to enjoy higher living standard the government must get out of the way. Regulations subsides spending and taxation are stifling economic growth.,0
@CathieDWood Except you have no idea which companies will change the world. Many you picked will go bankrupt while those that do change the world aren't even on your radar. Morningstar gives $ARKK 1 star. It's the worst performing fund of 2021 &amp; 2022. My bet is 2023 will make it a hat trick.,0
To reduce #inflation #Japan could sell it's $1.2 trillion in Treasuries. It could then use the dollar proceeds to buy yen then use the yen to buy JGBs held by the BOJ. This would reduce both Japan's national debt by 13% and the money supply while increasing the value of the yen.,0

In Surprise Move Bank of Japan Allows Bond Yields to Rise @schiffgold https://t.co/Ol2XBfikY1,1
@ii_analyze @WellsFargo We had it. The bank was in business for 10 years. Never had a problem. My bank could have returned 100% of all deposits on the same day. How many banks can do that? I offered to add extra capital but was told by the Commissioner of OCIF not to.,0
@PMBlockchainDAO @ii_analyze @WellsFargo Technically but since the bank made no loans it didn't need that much extra capital.  The rules were written for banks that loan out their deposits. We didn't loan any of our deposits. Our reserves were 100%. So any capital meant our reserves exceeded 100% of deposits.,0
@wecandoit4sure @tomspettigue @WellsFargo I was a passive investor. But I think the bank's staff did an excellent job. That's one of the many reasons the outcome is so unfortunate.,1
Silver and Gold! Or Peppermint? @schiffgold https://t.co/Lxs5mj7eaV,0
@tomspettigue @WellsFargo The bank was never accused. It was suspected which resulted in an investigated. But the investigation proved the suspicions were false. The problem was the investigation was leaked to 60 Minutes Australia which then accused me of being guilty despite my never being charged.,0
@ii_analyze @WellsFargo Correct we had capital just technically not enough. But regulators initially told me not to add any capital and that the bank was good on capital pending its proposed sale. But when they changed their mind they refused to allow me to add more or to allow the buyer to add it.,0
@MemesofWallSt @ii_analyze @WellsFargo No margin call. The bank had no debt and made no loans.  It had millions in cash and cash equivalents above what was owed customers. It was also current on all its expenses.,0
@tippleinripple @WellsFargo Yes the bank had excellent reviews on Trust Pilot until the government took it over. I have no control over what's happing now. All customer funds are sitting in cash in the bank.,1
@just_like_pike @WellsFargo No I was going to receive $25 million for my bank but regulators blocked the sale so they could force the bank into liquidation instead. They wanted to send a message they were tough on money laundering and tax evasion despite knowing that my bank was not involved in either.,0
@PlebSignalBTC @WellsFargo Yes I opened a bank in Puerto Rico and spent a fortune complying with all the rules and regulations only to be falsely accused by the media of committing crimes. That damaged my and the bank's reputation resulting in regulators putting it out of business to improve their own.,0
@ROICAHOLIC76 @WellsFargo Not at all. My bank didn't go to zero on its own. It was forced there by government. #Bitcoin won't need any help to go to zero. Plus I was the only investor in my bank. The investments that I recommended to others have done much better than Bitcoin over the past five years.,0

Regulators just fined @WellsFargo $3.7 billion for committing numerous financial crimes about 2% of the bank's market value. In contrast my bank didn't commit any financial crimes yet regulators forced me to liquidate it basically fining me 100% of the bank's market value.,0
@Bitcoin39825903 @saylor @MicroStrategy #Bitcoin is hardly scare and in no way desirable. If you want to lose your money there are plenty of ways to do it. You don't need to buy Bitcoin.,1

@CryptoFombi Yes they know they have to print even more yen to defend the 50 basis point target. That guarantees even higher #inflation which will require even higher future bond yields.,1
Because a 50 basis point yield on a 10-year JGB is also artificially low that level will be just as hard to defend as 25 basis points. It will also require the #BOJ to create just as much additional #inflation to buy JGBs. So the 50 basis point target will be raised repeatedly.,1

The Bank of #Japan blinked and pivoted in the opposite direction. After artificially holding the 10-year JGB yield at .25% the BOJ just raised the target rate to .5%. More hikes are coming. In the U.S. this means the #dollar and asset prices will fall and #inflation will rise.,1

@realMeetKevin @CathieDWood #Inflation is the one thing the #Fed can't under-achieve. Inflation will always be higher than the Fed claims. Cathie Wood hasn't a clue what she's talking about. If you want to host a debate between the two of us I'm happy to participate.,1
@MarkWal31147358 @CathieDWood Why all stocks are not as over-priced as ARKK.  In fact many are under-priced. Also #gold is only down 5% during the period of time ARKK is down 80%. That's just 6% of ARKK's past loss. So why should gold lose 100% of ARKK's future loss?,0
After today's 3% drop the @CathieDWood $ARK ETF is now down 80% from its Feb. 2021 record high closing at the lowest price since Aug. 2017. Despite the sharp fall shares are still over-priced. I think another 50% decline from here bringing the total collapse to 90% is likely.,1
"This story should be getting a lot more media attention. Falling productivity will put more upward pressure on consumer prices and downward pressure on real wages. As are result both #inflation and the #recession will get worse. #Stagflation on steroids.

If the #Fed raised its #inflation target up to 3% it would lose all remaining credibility. If it gives up on 2% because it becomes too painful to maintain it will likely do the same thing with 3% once that rate becomes too painful to maintain. The target becomes meaningless.,0
@BillAckman @federalreserve You're correct the #Fed won't get #inflation down to 2% but it likely can't even get it to 3% and keep it that low either without causing a severe financial crisis. But that's not as bad as the currency and sovereign debt crisis that's coming once the markets figure this out.,0

@GaltsonJohn #Bitcoin is not a threat to the dollar. It's only a threat to the net worths of those who buy it.,1
@Nick63586419 #Gold doesn't have to be backed by anything. Gold has its own value. It's used to back currencies which have no value so need to be back by something else that does.,0
@ez_krk https://t.co/nzkV35XY9c,0
@MarcTheBulll #Bitcoin has a higher price not greater value. But that will change.,1
@SteveJoDaTow A rock can't conduct electricity or be used to make beautiful jewelry. Gold is far more useful and scare than rocks therefor far more valuable. But rocks are still more useful and valuable than #Bitcoin.,0
Today #JamieDimon compared #Bitcoin to pet rocks. But that is not really a fair comparison as pet rocks actually have some utility. You can use one as a paper weight a door stop slingshot ammo or to decorate the bottom of a fish tank. If you have three of them you can juggle.,0
@OleThomasH Why would #Bitcoin crush #gold next year when gold crushed Bitcoin this year?,0
Don't make the mistake of thinking that #Bitcoin is forming a floor at $17K. It's forming the next ceiling. During this bear market every time Bitcoin takes another leg down it consolidates its loses prior to its next leg lower. These landings aren't bottoms. They're trap doors.,0

@BlueKavu Actually it's always a good time to sell #Bitcoin as there is never a good time to buy it.,1
A couple of economic data points that beat expectations is no reason to sell #gold or #silver. Traders need to turn off the computer algorithms and think for themselves. Until they do mindless selling will keep creating buying opportunities for those who do.,0

Why was EPB put into receivership tying up deposits for 5 months when it had no debt no loans no past due bills and millions in excess cash? Why force the bank to liquidate when a qualified soon to be publicly traded U.S. company with $360 million in cash wanted to buy it?,0
@STOIC_2001 It's down 9% from its 2022 high and may still finish 2022 negative.,1
#Gold is still down 2% in 2022 and #silver is down 1%. Many #Bitcoin pumpers will point to this decline in a year of high #inflation as proof that gold has lost its relevance. Yet in 2022 Bitcoin is down 63% and $GBTC is down 74%. I bet both gold and silver end the year positive.,0

@webtrading I have a pretty good idea why but at this point I'm not at liberty to speak frankly on the topic.,0
@harley_Quinn135 @forkhembo I didn't take any customer money and I didn't pump anything. You are confusing me with SBF. I had a 100% reserve bank and the bank operated exactly as we told customers it would.,0

@Ranen_26 Yes.,1
@forkhembo No. Even if those concerns existed the sale of the bank would have fully addressed them.  But if OCIF wanted the bank shut down they could have just suspended the license and allowed me to return all the deposits. They have been sitting in cash all the time.,0
@HighbrowHaze The bank had more than enough capital to cover deposits. There was also a buyer that will soon be listed on NASADQ with over $350 million in cash and no debt that was willing to add millions in capital above the regulatory requirement but OCIF refused to allow the transaction.,0
@MarcTheBulll No it's not.  I have had no control over the bank ever since June 30th.  Had the bank not been closed and put into receivership I could have returned every penny to depositors on that day.,0
OCIF decided to put Euro Pacific Bank into receivership despite its having no debt no loans no unpaid bills and a highly qualified buyer willing to add millions in additional excess capital. It's not my fault depositor's money has been tied up in red tape for over five months.,0

#Bitcoin is only down 1% today. The #Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is down 7%. It's trading at a 46% discount to its reported NAV. This could be the next shoe to drop. Maybe $GBTC lost some or most of its Bitcoin. The market is indicating a major problem. This isn't good for Bitcoin.,0
Maybe $GBTC loan its #Bitcoin out and now the borrower can't repay the loan. That means the NAV is really a lot lower. Maybe that's what the discount is indicating. Or may it stored its Bitcoin with a custodian that lost it.,1

@Trader_GA But people are selling #Bitcoin that's why its price is dropping.,1
Look at this chart? It's ominous. #Tether has never seen a collapse in market cap. Given the turmoil in #crypto one would expect a rise in Tether's market cap as crypto sellers park their cash in Tether. This looks like a run on Tether.

I never looked into #SBF as I never even considered investing in #FTX. But had I done ten minutes of due diligence the red flags would have been obvious. That so many in #crypto were so easily duped by an obvious conman calls into question their judgement on everything crypto.,0

@danheld It wasn't quite that low but I will definitely being saying that when #Bitcoin is back below $10. You've been telling people to HODL and keep buying from $69K. It's now 76% lower and falling. People got killed following your advice. Any who used leverage have been wiped out.,1

@StevenHasty1 @kevinolearytv Absolutely.,0
@MichaelAffhold1 @kevinolearytv Government exploits ever crisis to grab more power. It always does so under the pretense of protecting the public. What the public really needs protection from is government.,1
@eip1559 @kevinolearytv I did that on purpose. #Bitcoin is not sound money. It will eventually collapse just like #FTX.,0
@MarcTheBulll @kevinolearytv We had massive government regulation of all the banks that failed and would have failed but for government bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis. In fact every bank in the U.S. is far more leveraged due to government regulation than would be the case in a free market.,0
I disagree with @kevinolearytv. More Govt. regulation is not the solution. The lesson of #FTX is for investors to do better due diligence and not just foolishly jump on speculative band wagons. Also we need sound money with interest rates set by free markets not central banks.,0
@1_john_2_15 The media falsely accused me of using the bank to facilitate money laundering and tax evasion. Though multiple government investigations exonerated the bank the damage done to its reputation prevented it from operating profitably. So I reluctantly agreed to liquidate the bank.,0
@SpencerKSchiff I don't believe #Bitcoin has a long-term.,0
@SpencerKSchiff That may be true for some people but most will end up selling #Bitcoin to cover losses in other cryptos or #crypto related companies. Some sales will be forced due to leverage. The losses in Bitcoin will be extreme. So on balance this is a big negative for Bitcoin.,1
The #Dollar Index fell 4% on the week ending the week with its biggest two-day plunge since Mar. 2009. #Gold rose 5% on the week its biggest weekly rise since Mar. 2020. #Bitcoin crashed 20% on the week. A weaker dollar means stronger #Inflation. Hedge with gold not Bitcoin.,0

The reason @novogratz was able to cash out of so much #Bitcoin and other #crypto related assets was that @CNBC gave him and other crypto insiders a one-sided platfrom to constantly pump exactly what he needed to dump. The whales sold as they suckered the minnows to buy and #HODL.,0

If it turns out that @SBF_FTX embezzled money from #FTX to buy stakes in $HOOD or @Scaramucci's Skybridge those transactions will need to be unwound to clawback money to repay creditors. Maybe the #Democrats will have to return his campaign donations. This could be a huge mess.,0
#Bitcoin speculators still don't get it. It makes no sense to buy Bitcoin because you think a lower than expected YoY #CPI means the #Fed is more likely to pivot sooner than later. The Bitcoin selling related to the #FTX debacle has only just begun. Any rally is doomed to fail.,0
The #Fed is making no progress on reducing #inflation to 2%. Oct. #CPI rose .4%. That annualizes to an inflation rate of 5% more than double the Fed's goal. Negative real interest rates soaring budget deficits and a weakening dollar will soon drive YoY CPI gains to new highs.,0

Not only does today's 12% decline put the Grayscale #Bitcoin Trust at a new multi-year low but the 84% decline also resulted in a record 40% discount to NAV. @BarrySilbert marketed $GBTC as a superior alternative to #gold. It wasn't even a superior alternative to #Bitcoin.,1

@liberalcriticuk We don't want people going to Congress without first having real world work experience. As of now you can go directly from college to the House. That's very dangerous.,1

When the voting age was 21 by that age most voters were married had kids and had been out of school and in the workforce for 8 years. Today most 18 year olds never had a job and still live with their parents. Let's raise the voting age to 28. If I was still 18 I'd support this.,1
@pennyfleamarket @CrankyArtiste I do not support a draft. But voting and fighting have nothing to do with one another. If they did then being too old to fight would also make you ineligible to vote.,0

@jcivy91 Yes but a lesser evil is still lesser. Its a bad situation I agree. But standing on principal can result in the greater evil winning. But if you live in a state like California then you might as well vote #Libertarian. But in a swing state its not worth the risk.,0
I'm a #Libertarian at heart. Generally the best candidate on any ballot is the Libertarian. But if you vote for the best candidate you may help elect the worst candidate instead. The system is rigged. Therefore the best a Libertarian can do is hold his nose and vote #Republican.,1
On Friday #Bitcoin fanatics made fun of gold's 3% rise as Bitcoin was up 4%. But today's $40 #gold spike adds 2.5% to Friday's gain while Bitcoin's 6% plunge not only wipes out all of Friday's rise but leaves it 2% lower. #Silver rose 7% on Friday and it's up another 3% today.,1
@jarrodf_ @elonmusk We had the best and most affordable healthcare on the planet before government got involved. If you want high-quality low-cost healthcare we need the free market to provide it. So we must get government out of healthcare completely. The same is true for the rest of the world.,1

Since the end of Aug. the $GDXJ an index of junior #gold mining stocks is up 5.5%. During that same period of time the NASDAQ is down 11.5%. Lots of investors own big tech. Very few own junior miners. This is likely the beginning of a long trend. Don't be the last one onboard.,1
@natbrunell @SpencerKSchiff Zero. If it's higher than that it would still round to zero.,1
@SpencerKSchiff I think the chance of #Bitcoin going to $1 million is still zero. Maybe it has a 10% change of going to $100K. Not worth the risk. I'd rather speculate on something else with a better risk/reward.,0
@SpencerKSchiff I think the odds of #Bitcoin going to $20 million are zero. So your math is wrong.,0
#Bitcoin fanatics need to stop making fun of #gold's $52 rise claiming a 3% move is nothing compared to what Bitcoin does. Bitcoin was only up 4% today. Not nearly enough of an extra gain to offset substantially higher risk. The $GDX was up over 10%. The miners are a better bet.,0
#Gold had an out-side reversal week where it not only took out last week's low and closed above last week's high but this week's low was also a new 52-week low. #Silver also had a similar out-side reversal week but did not make a new 52-week low. Another positive divergence.,0
@nandoodles So why are you still associating with @elonmusk? Your failure to delete your #Twitter account now that #Musk owns the company proves that you are not only against free speech but you are also a hypocrite! Why am I not surprised.,0
@satoshisCPA Yes but #Bitcoin has no real value. #Gold does.  Also Bitcoin's market cap and daily trading volume are much lower.,0
#Gold is up over $50 today. Daily gains that large rarely happen. The positive divergences I have been pointing out between #silver and the miners likely mean gold has seen its lows. If so $50 daily spikes will soon be common. In fact gold may soon have its first $100 up day.,1

#Powell said he'd prefer to over-tighten to beat #inflation as it will be easy for the #Fed to use its tools to stimulate the #economy if it weakens too much. Powell doesn't get it. Planned rate hikes and QT will only succeed in crashing the economy not bringing down inflation.,0
"#Powell just threw cold water on the idea of a pause in interesest rate hikes causing an immediate and sharp sell-off in financial markets. The sell-off will likely continue until Powell ""clarifies"" his remarks to prevent the #stock and #bond markets from crashing to new lows.",0
Today's 75 basis point rate hike may be the last hike of the year. By acknowledging the lag between rate hikes and #inflation the #Fed gave itself the leeway to pause. Also the Fed's commitment to returning inflation to 2% over time does not indicate how much time it will take.,1

Defense likely saved the game from a bad call. Hopefully McDaniel will learn a lesson from the scare.,0
WIth less than 5 minutes left in the game and Pittsburg's driving I bet the Fins wish they had taken the 3 now. Not likely that the Steelers will score twice. But now they can win with just one TD.,0

@TurdFerg1989 @RIIlIlIIIll 4th and 3 his hardly a gimme. Plus even if you get the first you still need to go on and score the TD. That's hardly a sure thing. Everything favored taking the easy 3 to take the two-score lead.,1
@RIIlIlIIIll You don't need analytics to know that in a low-scoring game in the third quarter a nine point lead is much better than a 6 point lead.  Even if the Fins went on to score the TD it would have been a 13 point lead. So still two scores.,0

At the rate the National Debt and interest rates are rising before the decade ends interest on the National Debt will exceed 100% of federal tax revenue. The entire Federal Government would then consist of the Treasury Department which would just collect taxes and pay interest.,0
@end_of_freedom Not zero but close. But its all short-term. So as it matures it must be rolled over at the higher market rates. Over 1/3 of the debt matures this year. Plus there will be $2 trillion plus of new debt added.,1
@albyva No over a third of the National Debt matures over the next year. Plus trillions of new debt is added each year. The average maturity on the entire National Debt is less than five years.,0
When the National Debt hits $35 trillion next year at a 6% interest rate annual interest payments on the National Debt would exceed national defense welfare and education spending combined. At 8% interest would exceed Social Security national defense and education combined.,0
The 10-year Treasury yield hit 4.33% its highest since Nov. 2007 when the Nation Debt was under $9 trillion. Today it's over $31.2 trillion. At 4.33% annual interest on the National Debt would exceed $1.35 trillion more than is spent on National Defense or Social Security.,1

In less than 3 months the yield on 30-year U.S. #Treasuries rose from below 3% to above 4%. The problem isn't that the move from 4% to 5% will be quicker but that the move from 5% to 6% will be even quicker. I triple dog dare the #Fed not to pivot to prevent that from happening.,0
The 4.1% yield on 30-year U.S #Treasuries is now higher than the 4% yield on 30-year UK #Gilts. As bad as the #debt problem is in the #UK is much worse in the U.S. For now it's only the dollar's reserve currency status that's forestalling a U.S. #dollar &amp; sovereign debt crisis.,0

@mikedako1 @ninaturner You can't see the immediate effects on unemployment of raising the cost of labor. Also employers will pass on higher labor costs to customers by raising prices that will hurt low-income workers the most.,1

I don't understand how anyone can believe that since the U.S. #economy was able to handle 20% #interest rates in 1980 that it can handle that high a rate now. The difference is not only that we have so much more #debt now but that the maturities of that debt are so much shorter.,0
@zerohedge What's amazing is that despite record-high taxes taxes are actually much too low relative to spending. The difference is being paid for with #inflation. That's why the rate is now so high and going much higher. It's also likely that major middle class tax hikes are coming too.,0

Professor #JeremySiegel is correct that monetary policy works with a lag but he is wrong to think that all the #inflation being experienced now resulted from monetary policy mistakes made after Covid. The seeds for today's inflation were sown by mistakes going back to the 1990s.,1
10-year Treasury yields hit 4.08% today the highest since Oct. of 2008. It took the 2008 GFC to bring rates down. When yields hit 4.33% they'll be the highest since Nov. of 2007 when the National Debt was still under $9 trillion. Now it's over $31 trillion. What could go wrong?,1
Social Security benefits will rise by 8.7% in 2023 the biggest annual jump in 40 years adding over $100 billion to annual budget deficits. The extra money received by beneficiaries will then increase demand for consumer goods. The combined result will be even higher #inflation.,0
Another hotter than expected #CPI surprised investors. Sept. CPI rose .4% double expectations. YoY prices rose 8.2%. The 6.6% YoY rise in core CPI is the most since 1982. OER had biggest monthly spike since 1990. The #Fed is losing its #inflation fight. Soon it will surrender.,1
@sirbu_ion1 @BarrySilbert That's impossible as #gold is less than 20% off its all-time high. So even if you were dump enough to put 100% of your life's savings into gold at its record high you've not even lost 20% of your life's savings. But if you paid in a foreign currency you've barely lost anything.,0
@cryptomellow @BarrySilbert Of course they can. All closed end funds can sell assets and buy back shares. But there is a conflict as doing so reduces AUM thereby reducing fees. So managers are often reluctant to do that. So it often takes pressure from shareholders.,1
@BarrySilbert This is just a ruse. If you really cared about shareholders you wouldn't wait for the SEC to approve an ETF. You'd sell some #Bitcoin held by $GBTC and buy back shares until the 35% discount to NAV closed. But you refuse to do that as it would reduce your excessive 2% annual fee.,0

@mikedako1 @BernieSanders A business does not create poverty by providing someone with a job. The job helps lift the employee out of poverty. Even if it does not lift them all the way out it helps. People only take jobs if doing so is in the best interest. If there was a better job they would take it.,1

@naahs7 @ninaturner The bank is just one of my companies. I employed about 70 people there. Too bad government forced it to go out of business. Capitalism creates good jobs. Governments destroy them. How many people do you employ?,0
@ninaturner I'm curious how many people do you employ? Also do you pay each one of your employees at least $25 per hour?,0
@ninaturner What if an unskilled worker can't provide an employer with $25 per hour worth of productivity? Should it be illegal for such an individual to get a job? If you make it illegal for unskilled workers to get jobs they will never acquire the skills needed to get higher paying jobs!,0
@ninaturner I agree. To eliminate poverty we must reduce the size and power of governments around the world. For poverty to go down labor productivity must go up. There is an inverse correlation between freedom and poverty. Government's cause poverty. Free market capitalism eliminates it.,1
@Ilhan But shareholders pay CEOs and all other workers.  So if shareholders are so greedy why do they overpay their CEOs?  Maybe it's free markets you dislike. If you want workers to earn more repeal federal regulations that drive down worker productivity thereby lowering their wages.,0

Since my bank moved to Puerto Rico in 2017 it received 24714 new account applications. Compliance rejected 18561 and closed 5603 accounts for red flags. 98% of account applications were rejected or closed. @60Mins accused the bank of waiving applicants through &amp; no compliance.,0

@SpencerKSchiff That's because the Treasury bear market is just getting started. So it's just a short-term bottom. On the other hand the dollar bull market is very old as is the correction in gold's bull market. So these indicators are more significant of a meaningful reversal. Nice try though.,0
Today was a key out-side reversal day in the #dollar #gold and Treasuries. These are significant reversal patterns that strongly suggest a top in the dollar and a bottom in gold. For Treasuries I think the bottom will be proven false. Prices will soon fall through a trap door.,1
Yesterday the BOE was every bit as resolute as the #Fed of winning the #inflation war. But today at the first sign of trouble it surrendered. Inflation has won in the UK and the British had better prepare for high inflation as a way of life. The Fed will make the same choice.,1
Pending home sales fell 2.0% in Aug. more than twice estimates and the 3rd consecutive monthly drop. YoY sales are down by 24.2%. As sales fall prices follow. As prices fall defaults follow. As real estate wealth vanishes consumer spending falls. A financial crisis ensues.,0
Yesterday the average rate on 30-year fixed rate mortgage hit 7.08% the first time above 7% since 2002. This is also the biggest YoY rise in mortgage rates since 1981. That year 30-year fixed rate mortgages peaked at 18.63%. Current mortgages rates still have a long way to rise.,1
"Today's sharp pivot by the BOE amounts to a key ""emperor has no clothes"" moment for central banks. They've barked loud about their mutual resolve to fight #inflation but high levels of sovereign and private debt mean they have no bite. They are paper tigers that will soon fold.",0
SF Federal Reserve Bank Pres. Mary Daly said that while the Fed is ‚Äúresolute‚Äù about bringing down high #inflation it wants to do so ‚Äúas gently as possible‚Äù so as not to drive the economy into a downturn. Too late for that. Financial crisis on deck. The #Fed's resolve is feigned.,0
There's dissension building in the ranks of the #Fed. Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans implied that he feels the Fed may have moved to fast in raising interest rates to fight #inflation. This could be the first sign that the Fed will soon fold just like the BOE.,1
#Apple is cutting production of the new iPhone 14 due to weaker than expected demand. This is more evidence of #inflation and #recession as weaker economies and higher prices mean consumers can't afford to buy the newest iPhones. This problem is likely not confined to iPhones.,1

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is now 6.87% its highest in 20 years. But as the #Fed still has a lot more work to do on rate hikes and the realization that #inflation is here to stay has yet to set in mortgage rates still have along way to rise. 8% by year-end seems likely.,1
The more problems the world has the more the U.S. benefits because the world buys dollars whenever there's a problem even if the U.S. has a bigger problem. That props up the U.S. economy while putting more pressure on every other economy. It's our currency but their problem.,1
‚ÄúIt's our currency but it's your problem‚Äù was made famous in 1971 by John Connally Richard Nixon's treasury secretary. But back then the problem was a weak #dollar. The strong dollar is now an even bigger problem because it will push #inflation outside the U.S. much higher.,0

Because the Fed's #inflation fight makes the #dollar stronger it will sent already high inflation around the world much higher. As U.S. trade deficits soar the supply of goods outside the U.S. declines. U.S. trade deficits are a bigger threat to #Europe than #Russian sanctions.,1

For years Wall Street told investors not to buy #gold because there was no #inflation. Now Wall Street is telling investors to sell gold because the #Fed will fight hard to vanquish the high inflation they didn't see coming. The Fed will surrender. Inflation will win. Buy gold.,0
Central banks spent over a decade creating #inflation while using rigged #CPI indexes to claim there wasn't enough inflation. Now that the consequences have materialized it's too late to put out the fire. What we have seen thus far with inflation is just the tip of the iceberg.,0
"The reason governments want to ""fight"" #inflation with tax cuts and not spending cuts is that the former is popular with voters. But what voters don't understand is that only the latter will work. Tax cuts will actually make the inflation problem they're supposed to solve worse!",0
Tax cuts alone won't increase supply. Govt. must also cut spending. That's because Govt. spending is taxation and must be paid for. Cutting taxes just means Govt. must borrow more or print more. So whatever tax cuts add to the private sector Govt. debt or #inflation removes.,0
The entire world has an #inflation problem but no country is raising interest rates enough or making the cuts to government spending necessary to solve the problem. For now the #dollar's reserve currency status allows it to benefit even though its got the biggest problem.,0
@AlanGrean @bi_cheong But they didn't. They just kept the cash. My guess is the UK government spent it.,0
@Markets_Options I didn't pick the date. Gordon Brown of the U.K. picked the date to sell British #gold. I just pointed out what a mistake that was.,0
In 1999 the #British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown sold almost all of Great Britain's #gold at an average price of about 160 pounds per once. Tonight the price of gold hit a new record high of about 1580 pounds. That's almost a 10-fold increase. What an epic fail.,1
The #British #pound just hit an all-time low against the U.S. #dollar trading below 1.05 for the first time ever. It looks like the latest round of deficit-financed tax cuts will backfire as a weak pound causes the cost of living to rise by more than the value of the tax cuts.,0

@Economicpop101 @60Mins @MattGoldstein26 It's the way they deceptively edited the one hour interview.  That's why 60 minutes still refuses to release the raw video. I may finally get it to help prove aggravated damages.,1
The @60Mins broadcast that was recently ruled to be defamatory was part of a collaborative effort that included The NY Times. While the Times article itself hasn't been ruled defamatory I think @MattGoldstein26  should publicly condemn his partner for their unethical journalism.,1
The Grayscale #Bitcoin Trust one of @CNBC biggest advertisers is now down 81% from its high. The drop #gold campaign that launched in May of 2021 pumped the price of $GBTC to $17.4 in June. In the over three years since GBTC is down 36% while gold is up 23%. That's a 59% loss!,1
Bank of America expects the U.S. economy to enter #recession in the 1st half of 2023. But since the U.S. #economy is technically already in recession that means BOA's real forecast is that the current recession that began in Q1 of 2022 will continue and get much worse in 2023.,0
@ComradeQuestio7 @60Mins Yes everything I said was true and is supported by evidence. Everything 60 Minutes imputed was false supported by no evidence.,0
The #Fed can't slow #inflation by slowing the #economy. It must allow positive real interest rates to slow spending and rebuild savings. The U.S. Federal Govt. must also cut spending. Then both must allow the financial crisis that is sure to ensue to unfold without any bailouts.,0

When @60Mins falsely accused me of using my bank to help Australians launder money and evade taxes there were lots of articles written that repeated the false allegation. But now that an Australian judge has ruled that broadcast defamatory not a single article has been written.,0
Will the #Fed keep fighting #inflation once the big banks that were bailed out in 2008 are on the verge of failure again? The only way to continue the #inflation fight is to let them fail as well as other major companies that have relied on cheap credit and inflation to survive.,0
The reason #Powell didn't fight inflation sooner was that he knew raising rates would cause a huge problem. But once #inflation became the huge problem the #Fed had no reason not to fight it even though doing so later would create a greater crisis than had he done so sooner.,0
@Cryptopagetv Reduced demand. Plus when government spending is financed with debt it either directly increase #inflation if financed by a central bank or reduces the supply of goods and services if financed by the private sector.,0
@KyleWat63548798 Yes government spending = taxation. The only variable is how its paid for. The UK wants the British to pay for government spending with #inflation.,0

Remember the 2008 financial crisis was obvious for years yet hardly anyone on Wall Street and no one at the #Fed saw it coming. The crisis we are rapidly approaching will be much greater and is actually even move obvious. The same fools who missed 2008 are as clueless as ever.,0
The highest the yield has been on the 10-year U.S. #Treasury in the last 20 years has been 5.44%. But in 1987 the yield was over 10% and in 1981 almost 16%. The U.S. has higher debt and #inflation now than in 1981 and both are on the rise. So yields should be higher now as well.,1
The yields on a 5-year U.S. Treasury is now 3.94% the highest since Nov. of 2007. 5.25% will be the highest in 22 years. The low interest rate environment that has propped up an overly-indebted U.S. economy is crumbling. Soon the entire house of cards built on top will collapse.,1
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries is now 3.67% the highest since Feb. of 2011. At 3.75% it will be the highest since April of 2010 and at 4.15% the highest since July of 2008. This could easily happen before the end of Oct. The National Debt has more than tripled since 2008.,1
@Drapertoshi Tough luck. I have a generator.,1
As #bond prices plunge and yields soar surging debt service costs will add to the upward pressure on consumer prices and downward pressure on asset prices. It will get much worse once bond investors finally figure out that #inflation will rise as #GDP and #employment fall.,1
@S_Radude The solution is free market capitalism. No one individual or group of individuals can solve these problems. Only the free market can do that. Groups of individuals working in government caused the problems. That's the problems.,0
Also higher #unemployment leads to larger federal budget deficits. If financed by the #Fed that increases money supply pushing up #prices. If financed by the private sector it reduces capital investment which lowers supply also pushing up prices. @ewarren is finally right!,1
Rising unemployment makes #inflation worse. When people lose their #jobs demand falls but not to zero. The unemployed spend with #unemployment benefits savings and credit. But they no longer add anything to the supply of goods and services. The net effect pushes prices higher.,0

@SwilsonLV Now I assumed tax revenue rise 5% per year.,0
The weighted average maturity of the $31 trillion National Debt is 5 years. If rates stay near 4% over the next 5 years and the debt grows to just $40 trillion the annual cost to service the debt will be $1.6 trillion. At 8% $3.2 trillion more than half of total tax revenue.,0

Actually the 85% jump in mortgage payments was based on 6.1% mortgage rate. I just noticed the rate jumped to 6.4% over the weekend. Will hit 7% soon. That will more than double the price of financing a new home from two years ago. How many Americans can afford that?,1
@wordsinusername That means the cost to buy is much higher as mortgage rates have also risen from 3.1% to 6.4%,1
Homebuilding sentiment fell for the 9th month in a row to a much lower than expected 46 the lowest since May of 2013. Given that monthly mortgage payments to buy a new home have risen by 85% in the past two years and are headed much higher sentiment has a long way to fall.,0
@steve_alarm No I got an exemption from the high tax rates. So my rate is 4%.  Lower than the 7% i paid in CT but higher than the 0% I would have paid in FL. Now I reduced my federal tax liability with the move but that didn't reduce the taxes I paid to Puerto Rico as a result of the move.,0
@steve_alarm That's the last thing Puerto Rico needs. Local taxes here are already much higher than in any state.,0
@alextwig82 Its been getting worse in recent years not better.,0

@HeidiWa54984860 Yes and that resulted in a lot of extra tax revenue for #PuertoRico. Had the government not created those low-tax incentives for business to relocate to Puerto Rico the government would have collected a lot less in tax revenue.,1
@Greatpicts Yes some parts of the island got hit with heavy flooding. But that should not result in 100% of the island losing power. Most of the population lives in San Juan which was far from the actual storm. We got a lot of rain as a result but no serious flooding.,0
@MidwestHedgie @GuyGentile No its been a very high-tax jurisdiction for a long time. The low taxes have only been around since 2012 and mainly for people who move here from the states like I did. But I pay higher taxes to #PuertoRico than I would have paid to Florida had I moved there instead.,0
@henry_huge1 Yes I do.  But a lot of people in Puerto Rico don't.,0
@amin199998 @rainmakerOTA Not true. People in Puerto Rico pay very high taxes to the Puerto Rico government.  They just don't paying income taxes to the Federal Government. The Puerto Rico government wastes the money.,0
@rainmakerOTA Yes closing my bank which did an excellent job of preventing money laundering and tax evasion and had more than enough cash to cover 100% of deposits and no debt was more important than fixing an antiquated and neglected power grid.,1
All of #PuertoRico is without power as a #Fiona a category 1 hurricane barely grazed the south and west costs of the island. The real threat to Puerto Rico is man made. If we had more economic freedom and less government weathering this minor hurricane would have been a breeze.,0

Anyone buying the long end of the #bond curve as a bet on a #Fed pivot will be correct on the pivot but will lose the wager. Long bonds are now benefitting from the perception that the Fed will control #inflation. The pivot will reveal that inflation will run out of control.,1
For nearly 14 years the #Fed supported the U.S. economy on a foundation of cheap money. This created malinvestment misallocation of resources asset bubbles and excessive debt and consumption. As this foundation crumbles a financial crisis and severe #recession are inevitable.,0
The yield on a 1-year Treasury Bill just hit 4%. But with over 8% #inflation real yields are lower now then when the yield was 1/4% and inflation was under 2%. It won't take long for the yield to move from 4% to 5% but if inflation rises above 10% real rates will have fallen.,0

Advisors recommending fixed income now that yields have risen don't understand the difference between nominal and real interest rates. Given that the #inflation rate has risen more than nominal interest rates real interest rates are lower now than when the Fed had rates at zero.,0
Everyone expects #inflation to return to 2% as we had 2% inflation before Covid. But Covid was only the spark. The Fed started building an inflation powder keg in 2008. The Fed can't put out the fire with negative real interest rates and without large Federal Govt. spending cuts.,1

"Jeff Gundlach is wrong to think the Fed's rate hikes might result in an annual #CPI of -6%. Even the 2008 financial crisis didn't result in one year of falling consumer prices. The ""#deflation"" risk is only in financial assets. Consumers won't get relief from rising goods prices.",0
Plus the correct 3-year increase is 16.3%. But again that is only if #inflation comes down to 2%. It's far more likely the 3-year increase will be 20% -25%!,0
Actually I forgot about compounding. The actual increase over the two years was 14%.,1
@JackBai88718053 Yes I missed that. you are correct.  So it's worse than I thought.,0
Annual consumer price increases are cumulative. YoY Aug. 2022 #CPI rose 8.3% but YoY Aug. 2021 CPI rose 5.3%. That means the cost of living is up by 13.6% in just two years. Even if the #Fed reduces Aug. 2023 YoY CPI to 2% Americans would pay a 15.6% #inflation tax every year.,0

(2/2) letting customers lose their deposits. 5. Force the Federal Govt. to slash spending including making deep cuts to Social Security and Medicare. 6. Force the U.S. Treasury to default and restructure the National Debt with holders of Treasuries taking significant haircuts.,0
(1/2) The #Fed can return to 2% #inflation if it does all of the following: 1. Crash the stock bond and real estate markets. 2. Allow a severe #recession with no stimulus. 3. Allow a worse financial crisis than 2008. 4. Allow big banks to fail without bailing any out including,0
When it comes to successfully fighting #inflation there is a 0% chance the #Fed will do too much. But there is a 100% chance it's rate hikes will make the current #recession much worse and create a financial crisis which risks turning the inflation problem into #hyperinflation.,0
"Inflation is moving higher despite a ""strong"" #dollar and @POTUS dumbing #oil on the market. Imagine how much higher #inflation will rise when the dollar turns lower the Strategic Petroleum Reserve runs dry and the #Fed returns to QE as the current #recession gets much worse.",0
In 2008 the #Fed sold the nation's soul by making a deal with the #Inflation devil. This bought the Fed some time to delay the day of reckoning. But after more than a decade of kicking the can down the road the Devil has finally returned to collect.,1
Don't miss my live appearance today with @LizClaman on #FoxBusiness at 3 PM EDT. We will discuss today's #CPI report why #inflation gets stronger as the #economy gets weaker and why the #Fed falls further behind the inflation curve with each interest rate hike!,1
@soldatthetop @POTUS Yes plus actually rents are up more than double the CPI numbers.,1
While @POTUS brags that headline #CPI only rose by .1% over the past two months YoY food and food at homes prices rose by 11.4% and 13.5% the biggest gains since 1979 shelter rose by a record 6.24% rents by 6.74% the most since the early 1980s and healthcare rose by 24.3%.,1
Imagine how much higher the #CPI would be if @POTUS  wasn't draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Once the reserve is empty imagine how high #oil prices will rise if we ever fill it back up again. Then imagine how much higher oil prices will ultimately rise if we don't.,0
The #Fed is no closer to its goal of getting #inflation down to 2% than it was when interest rates were still at zero. Even if it raises interest rates to 5% next year higher than most anyone expects it will still be no closer to that goal. In fact it may be even further away!,1
The way investors react to higher than expected #inflation fits the definition of insanity. Every time inflation numbers come out higher than expected investors buy dollars and sell #gold as they expect more #Fed rate hikes to finally succeed in bringing inflation back down.,1
@1_john_2_15 I am a very successfully business man. The bank was just one business that didn't succeed. But he bank failed due to no fault of my own. I can't control defamation nor how politically motivated regulators react to it. But not a single customer of my back lost one cent.,0
What happens if a year from now YoY #inflation surprises by coming out at 12% instead of the 11% expected? Will investors take that as a sign that the #Fed will finally get tough on inflation and buy the dollar and sell gold? Will 20% YoY inflation still be bearish for gold?,1
Once again the market's reaction to much higher than expected #inflation is wrong. Inflation is here to stay and will get much worse despite rate hikes due to over a decade of inflationary monetary and fiscal policy. This is very bearish for the #dollar and bullish for #gold.,0
The days of sub 2% inflation are gone.There's no going back to the anomaly experienced between the 2008 Financial Crisis and 2021. The #inflation chickens the #Fed released with QE have finally come home to roost. The price increases experienced thus far are just the beginning.,0

@Michael00726927 I am not complaining. The #Fed needs to raise rates even more aggressively than it has. I am just pointing out how much Americians will suffer as a result of what the Fed must do so solve the problem it created.,0
Inflation and artificially low interest rates benefit debtors at the expense of creditors. As the world's largest debtor the U.S. benefitted more than any other nation. As the world raises interest rates to fight #inflation the U.S. will suffer more than any other nation.,1
I left out that the Fed's reckless monetary policy also enabled asset bubbles that further distorted the economy and the allocation of resources and capital. As a result the economy produced too much of what we don't need and too little of what we do.,0
@partialjustice It did just nor reported properly in official statistics. Plus a lot of the inflation went into financial assets first.  Now its moving into goods. Also the U.S. was able to export a lot of that inflation abroad as evidenced by soaring trade deficits. That can't last.,1
The #Covid lockdown related supply shortages didn't cause the #inflation problem. Neither did #Russian sanctions nor the #Ukraine war. These where just catalysts. The problem originated years ago when the #Fed introduced QE and ZIRP enabling excess #government spending and #debt.,0

@jcBoxer Why I think the British were better off under a monarchy than then are now under a democracy. So I am paying tribute to the British monarchy in honor of the passing of their queen.,1
As #British citizens mourn the loss of their beloved #QueenElizabeth they should also mourn the freedom they lost in the transition from #monarchy to #democracy. No historic monarch even attempted to tax the British public anywhere near as much as elected officials tax them now.,0

@originalTFP There we some temporary factors that delayed the impact of the inflation the ECB created on consumer prices. Now those effects are finally being experienced and they will get much worse. Supply problems are just making the situation the ECB created worse.,0

A #depression won't solve the #inflation problem. A depression will result in annual Federal budget deficits of $5 trillion or higher and over $10 trillion in maturing Federal debt that must be resold. $15 trillion in annual QE means money supply soars as goods supply collapses.,1
@The_5P No thanks to the size of the national debt and its short maturity a #depression would send the printing presses into overdrive. An inflationary depression would send long-term nominal bond yields soaring well above 14.8%,1
The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond just hit 3.5% its highest since June of 2014. The next major residence is the June 2007 high of 5.4%. The scary part is that once that high is taken out which may occur soon yields could easily spike to retest the 1981 high of 14.8%!,1

@eshudokan @mrbigcog They weren't alien. My bank could have withstood a run where every customer withdrew 100% of their deposits on the same day. No other bank is that strong.

@stocks_crypto2 @mrbigcog That was necessary for me protect bank customers and make sure they would all get their money back as quickly as possible.,0
@mrbigcog No small bank no matter how seaworthy could have withstood those forces. It was hit dead on by a category six hurricane. No ship is built to withstand that.,0
@mrbigcog The bank didn't sink. It was sunk by forces beyond its control. Left on its own it was extremely seaworthy.,0
Markets rarely give investors much time to buy the bottom. #Bitcoin has been trading near $20K for the past 12 days. More likely $20k will prove to be a false bottom giving suckers plenty of time to climb aboard a sinking ship. Better to abandon ship before the bottom drops out.,0

Wharton's Jeremy Siegel couldn't be more wrong in believing that #inflation isn't as big a problem now as it was in the 1970s because the #Fed has only been too loose for two years. QE and ZIRP began in 2008. #Powell has a much bigger inflation problem to solve than did Volcker!,0

(4/4) putting more downward pressure on the economy and upward pressure on consumer prices. To mitigate the damage the #Fed accommodates larger deficits by monetizing them (QE) i.e. it creates even more #inflation. Expansive fiscal policy undermines restrictive monetary policy.,1
(3/4) expenditures rise due to both automatic stabilizers and higher interest costs to service the National Debt. The government then compounds the problem with additional spending to stimulate the #economy. This makes budget deficits even larger crowding out private investment,0

It's not looking good HODLers. I don't think my son @SpencerKSchiff wished for a #Bitcoin crash for his birthday. Hopefully he doesn't make the mistake of assuming the crash is a birthday gift to buy some cheap sats. No matter how low the price sats will always be expensive. https://t.co/e1uQDksstj,0
#Powell claims he wants to put out the #inflation fire by raising interest rates to cool demand. @POTUS wants to fan the flames of inflation by extending the moratorium on #student loan repayments. The result of conflicting policy will be hotter inflation and a colder #economy.,0
@Crypto__D_Luffy @SpencerKSchiff Yes millions of other people mostly young as well have made the same mistake as my son. He is not unique. So he will at least have a lot of company in the misery of his #Bitcoin losses.,0
@SpencerKSchiff As I wrote you're still young and still have a lot to learn.  The good news about making investment mistakes when you're young is that you have many years ahead of you to learn from your mistakes and to make your money back.,0
Happy 20th Birthday @SpencerKSchiff. It's hard to believe that you're no longer a teenager. My little boy has grown up. But you're still young and hopefully have a long life ahead. Despite your temporary obsession with #Bitcoin I'm still proud of the man that you're becoming.,1
#Powell finally admitted that fighting #inflation is painful. While true he's under-estimating how excruciating that pain will be. As a result markets are now tanking. But when the pain of fighting inflation is perceived as being bigger than inflation itself Powell will pivot.,1
This week's @schiffgold Friday Gold Wrap podcast https://t.co/VB9NrnM3yG,0
The reason #students pay for #college rather than borrow is to avoid future interest payments. But thanks to income based repayment most borrowers will only have to repay a fraction of what they borrow. Since college will be so much more expensive for those who pay few will.,1
It's not a coincidence that 87K more IRS agents are being hired and student loan repayments will be capped at just 5% of incomes and forgiven after 10 years. People with large loans will have greater incentives to under-report their incomes to avoid both taxes and loan payments!,1
@Beyond_wealth_ I talk about high tuition all the time. Tuition is only high because of government direct and guaranteed loans. Remove the loans and the high tuitions the loans support will collapse.,1
In fact because of income based repayment eventually it will be more expensive to get an education degree than a medical degree. Colleges will set up that specialize in degrees that relate to low-paying careers as those degrees will allow them to charge the highest tuition.,1
Personal income rose just .2% in July and spending rose a mere .1% the lowest monthly gains in incomes and spending since Jan. 2022 and Dec. 2021 respectively. The savings rate fell to 5% the lowest since Aug. 2009 when the Great Recession forced Americans to tap into savings.,1
For example: An education major who borrows $200K and earns $50K as a teacher will only repay $25K. $175k will be forgiven. In fact such an individually will be indifferent to borrowing $50K or $200K. Colleges will take advantage of this moral hazard by jacking tuition sky high.,0
Capping student loan repayments at 5% of incomes and then forgiving unpaid balances after just 10 years will encourage students who major in subjects that will qualify them for the lowest paid jobs to borrow the most amount of money. Can you think of a more asinine system?...,0
@WhiteHouse The PPP was wrong. It's one reason why #inflation is so high and going higher. Two wrongs don't make a right. There's hypocrisy on both sides which is why both sides are to blame for the problems. Making the country poorer by making college even more expensive isn't the answer.,0
Peter Schiff: Washington Goes Full Orwellian https://t.co/fkSuDO283c,0
@Smackden1 @SenWarren @POTUS But only because government loans enable students to pay much higher tuition. Before government student loans were available college was much more affordable and tuitions were very stable over the decades.,1
@SenWarren @POTUS The only reason college is so expensive and students are able to borrow money is government direct and guaranteed student loans. Absent these loans college would cost far less and students wouldn't need to borrow money. This plan will only accelerate the rise in tuition and debt!,0

Somebody Has to Pay for Student Loan Forgiveness @schiffgold https://t.co/5tMBxJQcd9,0
Once #studentLoanForgiveness passes most people currently paying for #college will stop and borrow the money instead. After all why pay for something that you can get for free by not paying? It's called moral hazard. For some reason governments never seem to grasp this concept.,0
#Biden's plan to forgive #studentLoans is merely an attempt to buy votes. Clearly the extension of the highly inflationary moratorium on student loan repayments beyond the midterm elections is pure politics. The $10K- $20K in direct debt forgivness amount to outright bribes.,0
#Biden's plan for #studentloanforgiveness will be a windfall for colleges and a disaster for the nation. With loan payments capped at 5% of incomes most students would have the same monthly payments on a $100K loan as on a $1 million loan. Tuitions will surge faster than ever.,0
July existing home sales fell for the 8th month out of 9 down 22.5% YoY the biggest YoY decline since April 2011. The Index fell to 89.8 the lowest since Oct. 2011 excluding a one-off spike during the Covid lockdown. Prices fall as inventories rise. It's a housing #Recession.,0

Soon new home construction will almost completely shut down. That's because it will be too expensive to build new homes that most buyers can actually afford. The housing market will consist almost exclusively of existing home that will sell for less than the cost to replace them.,1
"So the last time new homes were this unaffordable the nation had just experienced a financial crisis the U.S. economy was in the worst recession since the Great Depression and the S&amp;P was at the bottom of a 48% bear market decline. Yet ""experts"" claim now the economy is strong.",0
July new home sales crashed 12.6% a much bigger fall than was expected. YoY sales have collapsed 29.6%.  New home sales have now dropped during 6 of the last 7 months and are at the lowest level since Jan. of 2016. The supply of unsold new homes is its highest since March 2009.,1

Even multiple jobs don't allow workers to keep pace with #inflation. June consumer credit surged by a much higher than expected $40.1 billion while credit card debt soared at an annualized rate of 16% as consumer went deeper into debt to afford to buy higher priced necessities.,1
There was a net loss of full-time #jobs in July. All of the net 528K jobs added were part-time jobs most of them low-paying service sector jobs. Since the number of people in the work force keeps falling these part-time jobs went to people who already had a least one other job!,0

It's likely that the U.S. economy will never be in a #recession again. If we no longer have an objective standard to define one government will always be able to find some excuse to claim the economy isn't in one. Ironically we're not in a recession now. We're in a #depression.,1
There will be a big difference between the Volcker monetary policy pivot in 1982 and the coming #Powell pivot in 2022. Volcker pivoted in victory in his fight against #inflation. Powell will pivot in defeat. Investors who don't understand this difference will suffer large losses.,1
@andytriesthings @POTUS My bank did nothing illegal. The only issue is a dispute over regulatory capital. There is also no issue with solvency as the bank has more cash on hand than the value of its deposits and has no debt and no loans.,0
@Mo73967838 @POTUS The free market is much better at allocating capital than government.,0
"The July Chicago PMI ""unexpectedly"" plunged to 52.1 from 56 in June its lowest level in two years. Prices paid rose faster while new orders fell faster. This deterioration is further evidence that both the #recession and #inflation are getting worse early in the third quarter.",0
The $79 billion #ChipsAct @POTUS is about to sign is an unconstitutional example of socialism not capitalism.  Investment should be funded by the private sector not government. Paying for this bill will also result in even more #inflation. We need less #government not more.,0
The June 1.1% rise in personal spending doesn't reflect a strong consumer but #inflation. Consumers bought less but paid more. The YoY PCE deflator rose the most since 1982. The savings rate plunged to 5.1% its lowest since Aug. 2009 when the economy was also in a #recession.,1
https://t.co/lFRfAcg6tc,0
#Biden's proposed corporate tax hikes will reduce investment and supply thereby adding to the upward pressure on consumer prices. To fight #inflation with tax hikes they must target the middle class to reduce demand. It's much better to cut Govt. spending and reduce regulations.,0

Peter Schiff: Americans Paying for Big Government Through the Inflation Tax @schiffgold https://t.co/9UoVzcjFQS,0
@partialjustice I prefer the complete elimination of the income tax. But I don't like special treatment for carried interest and I don't like the government acting like the Mafia in that it shakes down billionairs for protection money by threatening to take away the carried interest deduction.,0
"The #Inflation ""Reduction"" Bill eliminates the carried interest tax loophole.#Democrats have talked about eliminating this for years but have always failed to deliver after being paid off by those who benefit from it. With midterm elections coming up history is about to repeat.",0
#Roku is down 28% in after-hours trading following a disastrous earnings report as #recession and #inflation caused customers to cut back. The stock is trading at its lowest level since Mar. of 2020 down 87% from last year's high. This is the #3 holding in @CathieDWood's $ARKK.,1
When there's a strong labor market and #inflation workers are able to demand raises that exceed the increase in consumer #prices. In an economy with a weak labor market workers are forced to accept lower real wages. That's exactly what's happening now. The labor market is weak!,1
Like all government bills The Inflation Reduction Act will achieve the opposite of its title. The Act will increase #inflation. The only bills #Congress can pass to reduce inflation are those that cut #government spending. This Act does nothing to lower the cost of government.,0
It's a lie for Janet Yellen to describe a labor market where real wages are collapsing as being strong. A strong labor market delivers real wage gains to workers that exceed rises in consumer prices. It's a weak labor market in which workers are forced to accept lower real wages.,1
Janet #Yellen claimed the U.S. economy just entered a new stage in its recovery. Apparently a #recession is now just a stage of a recovery. The truth is that if there ever was a recovery it's over. The recession is just six months old and will get much worse in the months ahead.,0

If #DonaldTrump were still president and U.S. GDP just contracted for a 2nd consecutive quarter there's no way the media would not be reporting it as a #recession. Instead the left-wing media is spreading #Democratic propaganda to redefine recession to pretend we're not in one.,0
The only reason weekly first-time #jobless claims show a decline is that the prior week's numbers were revised up to 261K. The 256K for the most recent week is above the 251K that was originally reported and above the 249K analysts expected. The tight #labor market is loosening.,1
Even though official #unemployment is low the current #recession even in its first 6 months is already much worse than most. In a bad recession 10% of workers are unemployed. So 90% are fine. But in this recession #inflation has already reduced 100% of paychecks by over 10%.,0
The Dems claim that we're not in a #recession because unemployment is still low. But weekly jobless claims continue to rise and mass layoffs are coming. In the meantime even though most workers still have their jobs they've all suffered huge pay cuts as a result of #inflation.,0
Q2 #GDP fell .9%. Despite the Dems' Orwellian spin the U.S. economy has been in #recession all year. With yesterday's rate hike more layoffs and #inflation continuing to erode purchasing power the recession will deepen in Q3. In fact Q2 GDP will likely be revised even lower.,1

https://t.co/VW2A1YfGGu,0
If you think the #Fed is independent today's press conference should put that myth to rest. #Powell clearly got the the #Biden administration memo that #recession is not defined by two consecutive quarters of falling #GDP. Powell even said it's not his jobs to declare recession.,1
#Powell said that it wouldn't have made much difference had the #Fed started tightening a few months earlier. I actually agree. By then reckless Fed policy had already done too much damage. The Fed should have acted years sooner not months sooner. It was too easy for too long.,0
He was just asked the question for a third time. This time he said the economy is not currently in #recession but again refused to answer if he thought the economy was headed toward recession. He also downplayed the significance of #GDP in defining a recession. He got the memo.,0
Powell was asked twice if he expected the economy to avoid #recession and if not how might a recession change #Fed policy. Twice #Powell refused to answer this question and instead went off on a tangent about the Fed's commitment to reduce #inflation. He doesn't want to answer.,0
#Powell said a significant balance sheet reduction is coming. So far the #Fed has made little progress in shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet. I think he's bluffing. Even if he's not the Fed will not be able to follow through. But the mere prospect is a problem for markets.,1
@ZenitCrypto For all the reasons you just listed. Buy what's out of favor and cheap. Contrarian investors with the correct thesis eventually make money.,0
Investors think strong economic data is bad for #gold as they think interest rate hikes will kill #inflation. Investors think weak economic data is bad for gold as they think #recession will kill inflation. They're wrong twice. The bubble economy will die. Inflation will live on!,0
"It's clear #Democrats are setting up #Powell to take the fall. They will run against the #Fed as much as against #Republicans. They will blame the Fed for killing Biden's ""booming"" economy in a misguided fight against #inflation they claim is caused by #Putin and corporate greed.",0
The combination of #recession and #inflation are taking a toll on Sherwin-Williams Co. The stock is down 12% in pre-market trading after missing on 2nd quarter sales and profits and lowering full-year guidance. Paint costs are rising and the housing recession is reducing demand.,1

Since #inflation is forcing customers to spend more money on food and less on higher margin items the solution for #Walmart is obvious. The company must raise food prices much higher to improve margins. That'll make it easier for traditional super markets to raise their prices.,0
July consumer confidence fell more than expected while expectations for the future sank to a 9-year low. June new homes sales crashed far more than expected falling for 5 out of the last 6 months and May's number was revised sharply lower.  The economy is clearly in #recession.,1

@PaulRiz504 @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Actually the economy needs this #recession. The sooner we get it over with the better.  What we didn't need was the artificial boom created by the #Fed that screwed up the economy up so badly that it made this corrective recession necessary to clean up the mess.,0
I'll be on @FoxNews tonight live at 10:20 PM EDT with Laura Ingraham on the @IngrahamAngle. We'll be discussing Janet Yellen's ridiculous claims that regardless of two quarters of negative GDP the U.S economy isn't in #recession and that there's no broad based economic slowdown.,0

The July Dallas Fed Mfg. Survey was supposed to improve to -12 from -17.7 in June. Instead it fell to -22.6. So far the July data has been very weak. It'll get even weaker after this week's 75 basis point rate hike. Q3 GDP will be weaker than Q1 and Q2. Q4 will be weaker than Q3.,0
T-mobile's class-action lawsuit settlement; $150 million to upgrade security &amp; $350 million to customers is a win for lawyers and loss to customers who will pay the cost. 76.6 million customers get $3.20 each and a few lawyers split $105 million tax-free if properly structured.,1
Share of Newmont Mining are down 10% this morning as earnings missed due to lower production and higher costs. #Inflation is making it far more expensive to mine #gold. But since investors still expect inflation to be transitory gold prices aren't keeping pace with mining costs.,0
"The Chicago Fed National Activity Index ""unexpectedly"" sank to -.19 in June its lowest level since Feb. The estimate was for .05. The prior month was also revised down from .01 to -.19.  My guess is that June will be revised lower next month. #Recession deniers need to wake up!",1
@SenWarren @POTUS Cancelling student debt would create massive moral hazard leading to sky-high tuition and surging future student debt. It would also result in soaring #inflation as the #Fed prints money to replace lost government revenue and fund the cost of paying off private loan guarantees.,0
@SenWarren @POTUS That's because Congress was dumb enough to make the loans or guarantee the debt. That enabled colleges to charge far higher tuition than had government credit not been available and it encouraged non-qualified kids to go to college who would've been better off learning trades.,0
The fight against #inflation is a fight against government. The sole source of inflation is government. Inflation results from the combination of budget deficits passed by #Congress and signed into law by the @POTUS that are then monetized by the #Fed in a process now called QE.,1

According to Sec. Yellen regardless of how of how many quarters #GDP falls an economy creating 400K jobs per month isn't in a #recession. What if those are 2nd or 3rd jobs for people struggling to pay bills or retirees going back to work as #inflation destroyed their incomes?,0
According to Treasury Sec. Janet Yellen even if the U.S. economy experiences two consecutive quarters of negative #GDP the economy won't be in #recession. Bust is the new boom. Will she be singing the same tune after GDP drops more in Q3 than either of the first two quarters?,0

Why is bad news on $SNAP earnings a surprise? I've been warning for some time that all those internet companies that depend on advertising for revenue are in a lot of trouble. All those companies depend on the same advertisers that in turn depend on the same broke customer base.,0
High #inflation is only bad for #gold if investors believe that tight money will successfully reduce it to 2%. Once investors realize high inflation is permanent gold will skyrocket. The #Fed will view permanently high inflation as an acceptable trade-off to a worse alternative.,0
What if instead of solving the #inflation problem a #recession actually makes the inflation problem worse? Few realize that historically the greatest inflations have occurred in weak economies not strong. Recessions reduce supply as fiscal and monetary stimulus increase demand.,0
The fall in long-term bond yields shows investors still don't get what's happening. They get the economy being in #recession but they don't get that a recession means even higher #inflation. A recession will cause larger budget deficits a weaker dollar and more money printing.,1
Given how weak the July numbers already are the decline in Q3 #GDP is likely to be greater than the drop during the first two quarters of the current #recession. If the #Fed doesn't reverse on rates and return to QE by year-end the decline in Q4 GDP will be ever larger than Q3.,0
The U.S. July PMI Composite Index crashed to 47.5 from 52.3 in June. Worse the Services Index sank to 47 from 52.7 in June. The expectation was for a slight decline to 52.3. Below 50 means #recession. Maybe this is the piano that needed to fall on the heads of recession deniers.,0

The Fed's balance sheet expanded for the 2nd week in a row. The #Fed is back peddling on QT and soon the process will reverse after barely getting started. With the economy in #recession and annual budget deficits over $2 trillion the Fed will resume QE to suppress bond yields.,1

There's no way to bring #inflation down without a severe #recession and a financial crisis. Laffer is correct that we need much higher interest rates. But that will prick America's bubble economy. We can't afford tax cuts. What must be cut are regulations and government spending.,0
Art Laffer still doesn't get it. He thinks #inflation can easily be cured without a #recession by letting interest rates rise above the inflation rate and cutting taxes. Rates that high would not only cause a massive recession but a financial crises. Tax cuts increase deficits.,0
The Atlanta Fed lowered its Q2 GDP forecast to -1.5% following -1.6% in Q1. So the super strong U.S. economy impervious to rate hikes has been in recession all year. If the economy is already in #recession with interest rates below 2% what happens after a few more rate hikes?,0

Export prices rose .7% in June and 18.2% YoY. 18.2% is a far more accurate measure of the true U.S. #inflation rate then is the 9.1% YoY rise in the #CPI. That's because while the CPI is highly manipulated export prices honestly reflect the cost of domestically produced goods.,1

@PopMelancholic I guess you weren't paying attention. My bank was cleared of all charges of money laundering tax evasion or any financial crimes.,0
Let me get this straight. The #Fed kept interest rates at zero for 12 years resulting in an unprecedented buildup in government and private debt and a bubble in everything. Then the Fed aggressively raises rates to fight 9% #inflation and the worst case is a mild #recession.,0
How is everyone so sure that we're not on the verge of a 2008 style financial crisis? Remember despite ample evidence the experts didn't expect the 2008 financial crisis either. Plus the economy is far more leveraged now than it was then and there's a lot more debt to default.,1

The PPI spiked a more than expected 1.1% in June and 11.3% YoY. That means more pressure on businesses to pass on their higher costs to consumers. Meanwhile weekly unemployment claims shot up again hitting 244K the highest level since Nov. of 2021. #Recession + high #inflation.,1

Pres. @JoeBiden said #inflation is our most pressing economic challenge and that tackling inflation is his top priority. If so why is his administration still stimulating the economy with close to $2 trillion in deficit spending? Where's his contractionary fiscal policy response?,1
@MarcTheBulll Interest rates should be set by the market not the Fed. That's the problem.,0
I wonder if an official #inflation rate of 20% will cause markets to price in a 200 basis point rate hike. The problem is that with each tiny rate hike the #Fed finds itself even further behind the inflation curve especially as higher interest costs work their way into the #CPI.,0
To get a 9.1% YoY #inflation rate the government is pretending that shelter costs are up just 5.6% YoY. That represents 1/3 of the #CPI. But rents and home prices are up 18% YoY. Plus if you buy a house with higher prices and mortgage rates monthly payments are up over 50%.,1
What if instead of talking about 9.1% #inflation the media acknowledged the true rate of inflation of about 18%? American workers are experiencing unprecedented declines in their real incomes which is why record numbers have been forced to work multiple jobs to make ends meet.,0
Imagine how much higher consumer prices would be without the strong #dollar which keeps a lid on import prices. But the dollar is only strong as traders think higher rates will kill #inflation. When they kill the #economy instead the dollar will tank and inflation will explode.,1
May #CPI up 1.3% 9.1% YoY highest since 1981. Real #inflation 18% highest ever. When will markets figure out that tiny rate hikes put upward pressure on prices. Until we get massive QT and large cuts in government spending and middle class tax hikes inflation will get worse!,1

@dggabber @RuyleTim We made money on fees. Account fees transactions debit cards wires foreign exchange conversion precious metals sales etc. But the compliance costs were the killer. The only way to cover those costs would be to make loans. The buyer was going to start doing that.,0
@MarcTheBulll You probably would have lost more. By the way I lost that $7 million and I bet I'm still much richer than you are.,1
I contributed $7 million in capital over the past two years most of which was lost due to the false allegations of money laundering and tax evasion by the Australian media. That's why the only viable path forward was to sell the bank so it could be rebranded under new ownership.,0
@RuyleTim We are required to hold extra cash to secure our cash. So the higher our deposits the more capital we need even though we are not making loans. For example we park $100 million in cash in a demand deposit in a major foreign bank we need millions more in additional capital.,0
@scn4 Actually yes I would sell the bank for anything if regulators let me sell it.  My main goal is protecting customers.,0
@MarcTheBulll No I'm not wrong. Where are you getting your facts? Have you seen my bank's balance sheet.  We have independent audited financial that show the bank is solvent.,0
My bank was not put into receivership for being insolvent. It was put there for being under-capitalized not having no capital. My bank has about $2 million in capital no debt no loans and enough cash to repay all depositors in full. The buyer was to add $7 million in capital.,0

I am committed to working with the Puerto Rico banking Commissioner to resolve the capital issues with my bank for the best interest of all the bank's customers. Click the Schiff Radio link to read my full statement. https://t.co/Ih0ByqQFRA,1
When the IRS agent at the press conference admitted the investigation didn't turn out as planned that's because when the investigation started he assumed the bank was guilty. But by the time it ended he realized the bank was completely innocent. But he's pretending it's guilty.,1
Since the bank has no debt and no loans putting it into receivership still means that depositors will eventually get most of their money back. But if the Commissioner just approves the sale she fully supported for the past nine months customers can withdraw all their money now.,0
@SwagggMD They found nothing illegal. They've been sitting on the application of the sale of the bank since Jan. The sale requires the buyer to add $7 million in capital more than the bank needs. They closed it so the J5 can pretend it's being closed for tax evasion and money laundering.,0
@Crypt0Ricard0 Well if I did anything wrong I covered my tracks completely as after a massive 2.5 year 5-country investigation they did not find any criminal conduct at the bank. The truth is there were no tracks to cover as we did everything right.  We actually went above and beyond.,0
After a 2.5 year investigation the J5 found that Euro Pacific Bank had excellent compliance protocols and did everything it could to make sure customers didn't use the bank to evade taxes or launder money. But instead of praising the bank it pressured regulators to shut it down.,0
Just to clear up any potential confusion the Commissioner of OCIF made it clear during the press conference that regulators found no evidence the bank committed any financial crimes. That not only includes tax evasion and money laundering but any other possible financial crime.,0
@Sharksimus Of course I deny it. The point of my tweet is that Puerto Rico regulators were very clear they found no evidence of any financial crimes. The U.S. government filed no charges. But the media is ignoring the bank's innocence and pretending it was guilty of crimes it did not commit.,0
@JohnnySpasmodic That's the pretense but no. The bank has no debt no loans and more than enough cash to pay off every depositor in full tomorrow.,0

@amin199998 I never told anyone to borrow money to buy #gold.  But lots of people like @saylor were telling people to borrow money to buy #Bitcoin at the top.,0
@1_john_2_15 That long investigation exonerated the bank. The J5 pressured OCIF to shut the bank down putting depositors at risk instead of allowing the sale as planned that would have protected all depositors to create the false impression the bank was guilty even though it was innocent.,0
Most of the news stories about my bank claim that it was closed for tax evasion &amp; money laundering even though it was made clear that those financial crimes had nothing to do with the closure. The media is supposed to expose government corruption not help them get away with it.,0
The IRS and J5 targeted my bank due to my outspoken criticism of excess government taxation and regulation. Their illegal efforts to punish free speech deprive me of property without due process and needlessly put thousands of customers at risk actually justifies my criticism.,1

I haven't been tweeting about the economy or markets because I'm focused on trying to #SaveTheBank. I want Puerto Rico regulators to allow the planned sale so customers will be protected with $7 million in new capital. Receivership will cause customers to needlessly lose money.,0
@jratcliff I'm doing a lot more than venting on Twitter.  But the press has been very one-sided. So I need to get my side out. Twitter is just the beginning.,0
@1_john_2_15 The Puerto Rico government won't allow customers to have their funds supposedly for their own good. But all their money is there. If there was a run on the bank the bank can handle it even if every customer ran at once. The lengthy investigation revealed no evidence of crimes.,0
When OCIF closed my bank it imposed a $700K fine for operating a bank without a license from Feb. 9th - June 30. But on Jan. 13 the bank filed the annual license renewal and paid the $5k fee. Despite near constant communication with OCIF there was no mention of a renewal issue.,0
@GuyGentile Who?,1
@achtera @TheChaosEngine1 It's not a scam. It's a 100% reserve bank. It has a positive net worth with all of its assets in cash as demand deposits in major banks. It has no debt.,0
@itsthatdeanguy There were at least 7 witnesses in room when she said it. Also they don't have any evidence of every telling me to put it in.,0
The only explanation is the IRS and J5 blocked the sale so they could use the closure of my bank as a successful example of their crack down on money laundering and tax evasion even though their own investigation proved the bank did nothing to facilitate any financial crimes.,0
@DGawr Not anymore.,1
@TheChaosEngine1 It's not. That's the point. It just doesn't have enough excess regulatory capital. But since the bank has no loans it's not really needed. The rules were written for banks with risky loans on their balance sheets. My bank has none. That said regulators told me capital was Ok.,0
"Puerto Rico put my bank into receivership due to ""insolvency.""  The bank has no debt no loans and enough cash to fully cover all deposits. A qualified buyer is offering me $17.5 million for the bank plus $7 million in new capital. Who pays $24.5 million for an insolvent bank?",0
@1_john_2_15 The bank isn't insolvent. It has more than enough cash on hand to pay every depositor in full tomorrow. What other bank can say that. Plus the bank itself has no debt. But regulators won't allow anyone to withdraw funds at the moment. The long investigation exonerated the bank.,0
@rahulajain That may well part of what's motivating the IRS. But what's crazy is that Puerto Rico which benefits so much from people moving here is helping.,1
@darshan0110 What does #Bitcoin have to do with it? I saved a lot of people money who might have paid over $60k for Bitcoin now worth less than $20k,0
Criminal investigations are supposed to be kept secret to protect the innocent in case no evidence is found to bring charges. In my case the IRS illegally leaked the investigation to the media which then convicted me of crimes there was no evidence to charge me with committing.,0
@cryptoBartman It's supposed to be secret.  But the IRS leaked the investigation to the press.,0
@cryptoBartman I never even had to go to court as there wasn't even enough evidence to charge me. Yet the media convicted me anyway.,0
@balibrianb Yes but it was the pressure from the bad press.  The regulators wrote they blocked the sale due to bad press.  So they shut it down instead.,0
@LLCoolTurtle I doubt it.  We only had about 100 Austrian customers.  If some of them evaded taxes they did so without any help from my bank.,0
Here's another headline you won't read. Peter Schiff's bank falsely accused by the media of facilitating tax evasion and money laundering is being closed because even though it's innocent it's premature conviction by the media ruined its reputation and crippled it financially.,0
@yukatabob Yes. I'm being punished for my political opinions. But I have a Constitutional right to express my opinions. The government has violated those rights by illegally going after me for expressing them. They deprived me of $17.5 million I was about to get from the sale of the bank.,1
@sxoliastis1 No it's still suspended. I have a buyer for the bank. But regulators won't let me sell it. They want to liquidate it so the media the IRS and the J5 can pretend it's being shut down for tax evasion and money laundering even though there was no evidence of either at the bank.,0
@csuhartanto It was several million. We have no loans. All deposits are held in accounts in large banks. We are a 100% reserve bank. Bank has no debt. The Commissioner of OCIF told me it was ok that the bank didn't have the capital as the buyer was putting it in. Then they blocked the sale.,0
@porc43267919 They should be ok in the BVI subsidiary. I think customers still have trading access.,0
Also it costs a fortune to run a small bank. That's why I never really made any money. The compliance costs are outrageous.,0
They never let me know they objected. I found out in C&amp;D order to shut down the bank. Had they ever told the 4% stake was a problem I would have restructured the deal. I just wanted out. I had to put in $7 million in the last 2 years to cover operating losses due to bad press.,0
@collectarmind No notice at all.  I was informed an hour before the press conference. The media knew my bank was being closed before I did. The bank's lawyer was totally blindsided too.,0
The reason regulators gave for tuning down the sale is that post sale I would own 4% of the company buying the bank. They said that due to the bad press about me they did not want me owning 4% of a bank even though the know first hand the allegations in the media are false.,0
Despite no evidence of crimes Puerto Rico regulators closed my bank anyway for net capital issues rather than allow a sale to a highly qualified buyer promising to inject capital far in excess of regulatory minimums. As a result accounts are frozen and customers may lose money.,0
@KoalaRunt The point of my Tweet is that the internet is full of articles implying that the false allegations in 2020 are true despite the announcement that no evidence of tax evasion or money laundering was found and no charges were filed. The media is still claiming that I'm guilty.,0
Where are these news headlines? Peter Schiff vindicated. After a 2.5 year investigation authorities of 5 nations found absolutely no evidence that Euro Pacific Bank or Peter Schiff facilitated tax evasion or money laundering. Those who reported guilt prior to charges were wrong.,0

If the U.S. economy is already in a #recession with historically low unemployment imagine how much worse this recession will become once employers react to the recession with mass layoffs. Plus as #unemployment surges consumer prices rents and interest rates will keep rising.,0
The #Fed hiking rates too much causing a #recession isn't a policy error. The errors were thinking it could hike without causing a severe recession waiting too long to hike not hiking enough lowering rates too much in the first place and leaving rates too low for too long.,0
@AllanLanzador Tonight for @OnLocals members. Tomorrow for everyone else.,1
The Atlanta #Fed lowered its Q2 GDP forecast to -1%. If they're right all year as #Powell insisted the strong economy could easily withstand rate hikes it was already in a #recession. Without rate cuts and QE5 the recession gets much worse. With them #inflation gets much worse.,0
Everyone is counting on consumers to keep the #economy out of #recession. But everyone is also counting on the #Fed to successfully fight #inflation by reducing demand. Since 70% of #GDP is consumer spending unless investment increases substantially this necessitates recession.,0
@LouisSolomon8 @Sonnenshein They sell #Bitcoin now to pay themselves their annual 2% fee. Since Bitcoin doesn't generate any yield almost all of the Bitcoin in the trust will eventually be sold to pay the fees until the fees no longer cover operating expenses at which point the fund will be closed down.,0
If @Sonnenshein really wanted to close $GBTC's 30% discount to NAV he would't file a doomed lawsuit against the SEC he'd sell #Bitcoin owned by #GBTC and use the proceeds to buy-back shares. That would reduce his AUM and lower his fees. Fees are more important than shareholders.,0

@MessagesRUS I think new stuff will be a lot more expensive so retailers will not be able to sell that either. Better to slowly sell the lower cost inventory they already have.  Not ideal but better than the alternative.,1
@saylor @MicroStrategy Increasing your stake by less than .004% seems more like an attempt to influence the market by demonstrating your conviction to other investors. But if you're so sure #Bitcoin is cheap why not buy $100 million? You must think there's still a lot of downside left in this move.,0
It's a huge mistake for U.S retailers stuck with inventory they can't sell to slash prices to clear the shelves only to restock with more expensive products their customers will be even less able to afford. Better not to buy new merchandise and sell current stock at full price.,0
@Ex1st3nZ_ @saylor @MicroStrategy That's fake news. You #Bitcoin guys are so gullible. But then that's why you fell for Bitcoin in the first place.,0
@saylor @MicroStrategy So $MSTR is down $1.4 billion on #Bitcoin yet you continue to average down throwing not so good money after incredibly bad. I's sure that but for your buying Bitcoin's price would be lower. But now that you're done the decline can resume until you waste more money buying again.,0
The final read on Q1 GDP is now minus 1.6%. Since Q2 will likely be negative too the #Fed and @JoeBiden will soon be forced to admit that Amercia's red hot economy has actually been in a #recession all year which will only get far worse with high #inflation and more rate hikes.,0
@AdvanceSapiens High #inflation yes but not high interest rates. Just higher interest rates. Despite the rise rates will remain too low.,0
@Abbas62413663 #Gold is flat. But gold mining stocks are way down as investors keep expecting the price of gold to fall. The fact that it's not is a very positive sign. I think gold stock investors have it wrong.,0
Today's outside reversal day likely means the bear-market rally is over and that #stocks will soon hit new lows. Investors are bracing for #recession and higher short-term interest rates than previously expected. But they're not bracing for #inflation remaining high despite both.,1
Every time the economy enters #recession it takes a larger dose of monetary stimulus to get it out. That's because the stimulus prevents real solutions from taking place and sows the seeds of a worse recession to come. This recession will now require a fatal overdose of stimulus.,1
Actually current real rates are closer to negative 6.5%. If Williams is correct then to reduce #inflation the #Fed needs to immediately raise interest rates to 9.5%. Since it's not even close inflation in 2023 is likely to rise from its current 8.6% not collapse down to 2.5%.,0
N.Y. Fed Pres. John Williams admitted the #Fed needs positive real interest rates to fight #inflation. He then said he expects inflation to fall to just 2.5% next year so a terminal rate of 3.5% will be enough. With current real rates -5% why would 8.5% inflation fall to 2.5%?,0
@TrakkHeaterz Higher rates alone will not to it. Money supply needs to shrink which means governments must reduce spending.,0
The Bank of International Settlement is warning that central banks must be aggressive in fighting #inflation now so as not to risk falling behind the curve which would require a far more painful policy adjustment later. It's much too late for that advice!https://t.co/eRykoRGxhc,0
@midnightecon @APompliano I never said #Bitcoin can't be traded. But none of the people trading it can actually use it for anything. That's the problem. Without a use people will eventually stop trading it.,0
@servandofinn @APompliano Lot's of securities have no value. There are shares of bankrupt companies trading for pennies per share.,0
@natbrunell @cvpayne @PrestonPysh The aspect that could be argued makes #Bitcoin a security is that miners collectively work to increase the value of the Bitcoin they mine while marketing the potential for appreciation then charge the network a fee for their services. I'd say its 50/50 the SEC changes its mind.,1
@APompliano For now. One day they may change their minds. I think #Bitcoin may be closer to a security than a commodity. To me it's better categorized as a collectable like a baseball card only with less actual value.,1
@natbrunell @cvpayne @PrestonPysh Why are you arguing for more government regulation to save #Bitcoin? I agree many #cryptos are securities. I think Bitcoin is actually closer to being a security than a commodity. But I don't like security regulations. I'd like the SEC abolished to let the free market function.,0
@geoffmckenzie1 No energy is stored as none can be released in the future. Energy is only wasted to create #Bitcoin. That computer power will mean nothing when speculators no longer want to collect and trade Bitcoin,0
@henleym25 They are likely still selling. If they buy any #Bitcoin it's simply to prop up the market to draw in more suckers so they can sell more.,0
@BREAKYOURSHAX Many of them didn't even start buying until the last year or two.  So those prior gains mean nothing to them.,0
"Because #Bitcoin whales succeeded in pumping Bitcoin close to $70K it's much easier for them to unload more worthless Bitcoin at $20K as those suckers who are buying think they're getting a bargain. These ""bargain"" hunters averaging down will eventually be known as bag holders.",0
Investors are making an even bigger mistake in thinking the #Fed will succeed in bringing #inflation back down to 2% than they did in thinking inflation was transitory. They are also mistaken in assuming that any potential #recession will be mild or that it will cure inflation.,0
"RT @zerohedge: Dallas Fed Plunges As Respondents Unleash Unprecedented Slamdown Of ""Disastrous"" Biden Administration https://t.co/Bwwfi0u7er",0
Busts are usually proportionate to the artificial booms that precede them. We had a financial crisis in 2008 and Great #Recession because the boom the #Fed created with 1% interest rates for about two years was so large. Imagine what follows 0% interest rates for nearly 14 years!,0
@TrakkHeaterz @BitcoinMagazine @GaryGensler Because you can't use Bitcoin for anything. All you can do is trade it. It's more like a collectable than a commodity. Like a baseball card. Though you can play games with baseball cards. The CFTC doesn't regulate baseball cards so it shouldn't regulate #Bitcoin.,1
@BitcoinMagazine @GaryGensler Then #Bitcoin is also the only commodity with no utility.,0
"It figures that I made the mistake of leaving out the ""s"" in ""mistakes""",0
Anyone thinking this #recession will be mild doesn't understand recessions. The longer interest rates are held too low during a boom the more mistake that must be corrected during a bust. Since rates have never been so low for so long this recession will be the most severe yet.,0
Trying to avoid a #recession is a mistake. When artificially low interest rates result in economic mistakes the best thing for the economy is to allow market forces to correct them. #Fed policy to avoid a recession that past policy mistakes made necessary is a bigger mistake.,0
@Puffchaddyinc Well they haven't and I doubt they will.,1

@ronricearoni @Disasterpiece05 I don't know. But I would think in almost 100% of the cases 15 weeks is a reasonable period of time. Sure it may take 8 weeks to know you're pregnant but it shouldn't take another 7 to decide if you want the baby.,1
@Disasterpiece05 When have you known me to sit stuff out?,0
#Disney is offering to pay travel costs for any Fla. employee who needs to travel out of state to get an #abortion. That's fine but under the new Fla. law women can still legally have an abortion up to the 15th week of pregnancy. Do most women need more time to make that choice?,0

@thinkyparts I never stated my belief. I just noted that it's a legal matter that needs to be decided on a state level. Personally I think life begins somewhere between conception and birth.,1
@Marxist_Eater I keep noticing typos. It's on my end not yours. I think in this case the third times the charm.,1
#Abortion is not about the right of a women to choose but about the right of the unborn to live. When life begins isn't defined in the Constitution. It's an issue The Framers left to the states that must determine if life begins at conception at birth or somewhere in between.,1
@goldseek Correct the only right they seem to care about is the right to an abortion. When it comes to just about every other decision you have no rights. The government gets to make those choices for you.,0
@stubble579 I care a lot more about women's rights than pro-choice politicians who have already destroyed so many of those rights. Women had a lot more rights before the Federal Government pass so many laws to limit or take them away.,0
@5tu_bagel @poggerslib It's not about my interpretation. It's a legal distinction that must be made. No one depends on a fetus for income so there is no insurable interest. Also not much support is required pre-birth but those legal decisions will be made at the state not the federal level.,1
@Kir65119385 I agree. I did not mean to take #Republicans off the hook. I only wanted to point out the hypocrisy of #Democrats who also support the Patriot Act but claim to care about the right to privacy.,0
@poggerslib It's not oppression from the prospective of the unborn. There are two lives involved in every abortion (maybe three if you count the father). So it's not as simple as the right to remove a wart from your skin.,1
#Democrats accusing the #SupremeCourt of taking away rights by overturning #Roe are hypocrites. Through their laws and regulations they have already destroyed the right to privacy as well as many other rights secured by the Constitution including the right to make many choices.,1

@goldexchangenyc Yes but then it will happen later as apposed to sooner and they can blame it on currency speculators and corporate greed.,0

The #Democrats raise a straw man by claiming #Republicans are accusing @POTUS of creating high #inflation in Europe. It's obvious that Biden's policies didn't create European inflation. It's the similar policies enacted by European leaders as well as the #ECB that are to blame.,0
@zeroricambio @POTUS That's just wrong. The problem is zero and negative interest rates and the ECBs asset purchase program that expands the money supply and allows profligate European governments to run otherwise unsustainably large budget deficits.,0
The fact that reckless monetary and fiscal policy by the #ECB and European governments created a huge #inflation problem in the Eurozone doesn't let the #Fed #Congress #Trump or @POTUS off the hook for the inflation that resulted from their reckless monetary and fiscal policy.,0
#Powell is wrong to claim that U.S. debt is on an unsustainable path. The debt is unsustainable right now. The only things sustaining it are the QE program the #Fed is ending and the artificially low interest rates the Fed is taking away. The fiscal time bomb is about to explode.,0
"#Powell stubbornly refused to offer an opinion as to whether he thinks forgiving billions in student debt without any offsetting spending cuts or tax increases would be inflationary. Since he must know the answer is ""yes"" he obviously doesn't care if #inflation gets worse.",0
#Powell's comments can't be taken seriously as they're based on the absurd belief that U.S. real #GDP growth will be strong in the 2nd half and that he doesn't care about the huge balance sheet losses the #Fed will bill Congress or the soaring cost of servicing the National Debt.,1
#Powell's confident prediction that the U.S. economy will experience strong real GDP growth in the second half of 2022 will prove just as wrong as his earlier forecast that #inflation was transitory. Not only will GDP growth not be strong the U.S. will likely be in a #recession.,1
How can #Powell claim the #Fed doesn't even consider the impact of rising interest rates on the Federal Govt.'s $31 trillion National Debt especially since the short-term nature of that debt means that his planned rate hikes will add over $1 trillion to annual budget deficits?,1
#Powell should not be testifying before #Congress if he refuses to answer questions on fiscal policy mistakes that might make #inflation worse. How can Powell claim he really wants to fight inflation if he refuses to offer any opinion as to what helpful actions Congress may take?,0
If #Democrats are so proud of their #COVID19 stimulus and claim that it did so much good then why not proudly accept the inflationary consequences of that policy? Just level with the American public and let them know that today's #inflation is the result of yesterday's stimulus.,1

Where in the U.S. Constitution is the Federal Govt. delegated the power to ban #Juul Labs from selling its e-cigarettes in the U.S? Lots of products people choose to buy aren't healthy. @POTUS isn't pro-choice. He doesn't believe the 9th Amendment established a right to privacy.,1
#Powell is committed to bringing #inflation down to 2%. But when inflation was below 2% the #Fed adopted a new goal that inflation average 2% over time. Since we've been so far above 2% for so long the Fed must target an inflation rate below 2% to bring the average down to 2%.,0
#Powell said he is not at all concerned about the #Fed realizing huge balance sheet losses when it sell assets currently $500 billion and rising as part of its QT program. Since the Fed sends Congress a bill for 100% of those losses the U.S. taxpayer ultimately pays the tab.,0
Proof that #Powell works for @POTUS as a closet member of his administration is his refusal to answer in the affirmative questions from #Republicans about freezing #government spending to fight #inflation by reducing aggregate demand. Powell knows his boss won't like the answer.,1
@guitarguy3 Unfortunately you are correct. These hearings are a farce. It's political theatre.,0
#Powell refused to answer a question from a Senator as to what #Congress can do to make the #Fed's job of fighting #inflation easier. Powell refused to answer because he doesn't want to get involved in politics. The entire point of this hearing is for the Fed to advise Congress!,0
I actually agree with @SenWarren that #Powell's interest rate hikes won't cure #inflation but will result in a #recession. But that's because the #Fed will not hike rates enough and #Congress and @POTUS will not help out by reducing government spending and repealing regulations.,0

The latest #Bitcoin fraud is the fake news story about a major #gold discovery in Uganda. Even @saylor spread this lie on #Twitter and @CNCB. I've always said that Bitcoin is fool's gold and so many Bitcoiners being so easily fooled by this joke proves it.https://t.co/gdlpmuB0T1,0
Today's #StockMarket rally is based on the growing consensus that the U.S. economy already is or soon will be in #recession; meaning the #Fed pivots sooner. #Gold's failure to rally confirms that investors still don't understand that a weaker economy means stronger #inflation.,0
@scotchpour @CNBC Then #Bitcoin can be described as a reliable store of value. It's a highly speculative asset that can collapse in price at any moment.,1
"I'm watching @CNBC appease its #crypto advertisers by encouraging its viewers to average down on #Bitcoin. The last guest claimed #Bitcoin has already proved itself to be a ""reliable store of value."" Despite Bitcoin's recent 75% collapse that lie went unchallenged by the host.",0
@attarian13 @coherentranter @BankofAmerica I did. My old insurance company left the state so I had to find another carrier. I did but someone dropped the ball and the policy I thought I bought in Dec. of 2021 was never bound until today.,1
@IHS2cts Then I would be rewording BOA for bad service. The bast way to get them back at BOA is to make them keep this low-rate mortgage until it matures.,0
@TyJones73440922 @BankofAmerica No I didn't have coverage. For some reason my insurance agent never bound the renewal policy as my prior carrier stopped writing coverage in Ct.  So my new policy is effective today but I am stuck with the 70% higher premium on the policy they bought for the past six months.,1
@KickAssKasss @coherentranter @BankofAmerica Probably but now I'm stuck with them as there is no way I'm paying off this mortgage. It's the only property I own that's mortgaged. I would rather have inflation wipe it out than pay it off. It's one of the reasons I don't want to sell the house as I hardly use it.,0
@a4floridacajun @BankofAmerica Refi. Are you nuts. I am at 3.375%  Refi would be closer to 6%. That's a lot of money on a jumbo.,0
@Pigface1957 @BankofAmerica That mortgage is actually a valuable asset to me. It's a liability now to BOA. I would be doing the bank a huge favor by paying it off.,0
@coherentranter @BankofAmerica I never got my letter. So I had no idea my policy lapsed or that they even purchased another widely overpriced policy. I didn't find out until I noticed the escrow payment online more than a month after it was made for the retroactive crapy coverage they bought. What a racket.,0
I have a mortgage with @BankofAmerica. It's a 30-year fixed at 3.375% so I don't want to pay it off. There was a screw up with my insurance renewal so BOA bought me a policy retroactive for four months that cost 70% more with less coverage than the private policy I just renewed.,0

@Grayscale @BarrySilbert @SenGillibrand If $GBTC becomes an ETF there will be mass liquidations from those who bought due to the huge discount hoping to sell at NAV once the trust became an ETF. That will crush the #Bitcoin market. Be careful what you wish for.,1
@RaysGalaxy Not really. Very orderly decline for #Bitcoin. I've seen Bitcoin drop over $5K in less than five minutes during previous declines.,0
Don't get excited about #Bitcoin being back above $20K. 20 is the new 30. This is just another bull trap. Nothing drops in a straight line. In fact this slow motion crash has been extremely orderly. No sign yet of any capitulation that typically forms a bear market bottom.,0
@natbrunell Well your life raft has already sprung a leak. You need one made of #gold. More seaworthy and sturdy.,1
@Makochin_tw I haven't deleted one yet.,1
"In Dec. of 2017 #Bitcoin hit a high of just below $20K. Bitcoin has been dead ""money"" for the past 4 1/2 years as its current price is about 2% lower than it was then. In contrast the price of #gold has risen by over 40% during the identical time period.",0
@MarcO34731260 @natbrunell Actually its probably cost me a lot of business. I bash #Bitcoin because it's the right thing to do despite the fact that it has likely cost me business.,1
"@natbrunell Hopefully that boat won't sink like #Bitcoin. I think it's time for 
you to abandon ship and I'm not referring to the sail boat. Instead of hiding out at sea while Bitcoin goes under sell while you can to salvage what's left. There will be no honor in going down with this ship.",0
Eliminating or reducing tariffs or the gasoline tax will actually increase #inflation in the economy. That's because lower excise taxes will result in increased demand while larger budget deficits will result in even higher interest rates or more money printing to finance them.,0
@dergigi This is typical BS used to pump #crypto. The comparison is not valid. The internet actually has real utility and improves the lives of all people who use it. #Bitcoin has no real utility. It's simply a pyramid scheme that enriches sellers at the expense of buyers. It's a fad.,0
"@nayibbukele That advice is as bad as your advice to buy the top. How can you say an investment in #Bitcoin is ""safe' when it has already lost 75% of its market value? You have no idea how low the price will fall during this bear market or that the price will ever recover to current levels.",0
Sure you can liquidate 24/7 as long as you don't care about price. But look at how much less weekend sellers are getting compared to what they would have received had they sold during regular stock market hours on Friday. Would they get that much less if they waited until Monday/ https://t.co/kWzBL153HR,0
@faybomb #Gold actually has value. #Bitcoin and #Ethereum do not. So that's a big difference. If you know crypto is a scam you either don't work in the crypto industry or you're a liar and a fraud.,0
"Reporters are asking crypto ""experts"" how low #Bitcoin or #Ethereum prices may fall. The problem is that all of the so-called experts they are asking work in the #crypto industry. They're shills not experts. Anyone who really understands crypto doesn't work for a crypto company.",0
What should really be a wakeup call for #Bitcoin maximalists is that Bitcoin isn't even acting as a safe-haven in #crypto. Over the past week as all cryptos collapsed Bitcoin's market dominance actually declined. So Bitcoin went down more than #altcoins. That's an epic fail.,0
A lot of people in the #crypto industry are saying that this crash is a healthy shake-out. I agree that it's healthy but not for crypto. That industry as we know it is dead which is very healthy for the economy. Crypto likely has a future but #Bitcoin will not be a part of it.,1
My forecast that the total market cap of all #cryptos would fall below $800 billion finally came true today. It just took a few days longer than I expected as #altcoins held up better than I expected. https://t.co/DNmfkwMK7V,1
You never get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression. #Bitcoin made a horrible 1st impression on the majority of individual and institutional investors who first bought in at much higher prices. They'll sell and never buy again. Without their buying the pyramid can't be rebuilt.,1
One reason #Bitcoin has so much further to fall is that not only are people selling Bitcoin but they're also selling nearly 20000 #Altcoins plus a bunch of #NFTs and shares of #crypto related companies that formed during the bubble. There aren't enough buyers to accommodate.,0
@rossiadam By recover I mean recovery to new highs as #Bitcoin has recovered in the past.  I did not mean to imply that it will never rally. Just that the high is in and the market will keep making new lows despite occasional bear-market rallies.,0
Long-term Bitcoin #HOLDers aren't worried as they've been through 73% declines before. But previous declines didn't involve anywhere near the total market cap lost during this decline nor did they involve massive leverage. This crash is just beginning. #Bitcoin will not recover.,0
"This app launched on Dec 23 2021. Back then #Bitcoin was still trading above $50K. I've tweeted a lot about Bitcoin since then and the price is now over $30K lower. Just like a government program this app achieved the opposite of its intended result!

@APompliano @WClementeIII Why? Energy is wasted producing #Bitcoin. The cost to make Bitcoin is irrelevent to its actually value. Plus as the price of Bitcoin crashes so too does the cost of creating it. Also there are already so many Bitcoin in circulation that no one needs why produce any more?,0
@rhcp_steve I suppose but only for the short-term. I really don't see this level holding up over the long-term. Also I don't think a rally off this low would even reach 25K before rolling over.,0
With Bitcoin's morning low near $18.7k the hope that the 2017 peak of $20K would act as support is gone. Objectively looking at the chart there really is no viable support left. Most likely #Bitcoin will find some short-term support along the long-term trend line around $6K.,0
@Akku6123 @CNBC No you can sell. Do not be a sucker and hold #Bitcoin all the way down. The whales are still selling. They wan't the minos to #HODL so they can get out at better prices.,0
@RJMacReadyBTC @CNBC No I started recommending #gold two decades ago when it was below $300. Plus while it's gone nowhere for 10 years it's up 80% over the past five years. Plus five years from now its likely to be above $5k while #Bitcoin will be well below $1K.,0
@AcertivoO @CNBC No everyone who bought #Bitcoin and did not sell will lose money. However I did tell people early on that if the wanted to gamble they could buy but they needed to make sure and sell in time. I never advised people to buy as I only give investment advice not gambling advice.,0
Now that #Bitcoin has collapsed below $20K and #Ethereum below $1K at least one person on @CNBC should apologize to their viewers for all the one-sided coverage and bad investment advice. As Bitcoin plunged 73% and Ethereum 83% CNBC pumped #crypto non-stop the entire way down.,0
Pres. @JoeBiden claims high #inflation isn't his fault as other countries are also experiencing high inflation. That's because leaders of other countries made the same mistakes he did. More importantly so did their central banks. This doesn't let #Biden or the #Fed off the hook.,1
@IncomeSharks If they don't sell eventually they will.,0
This chart would look very weird if #Bitcoin didn't drop down to the yellow support line. My guess is that there will be some kind of dead-cat bounce off that line but don't get too excited #HODLers. That bounce may be your last change to get out above $10K. Enjoy the weekend. https://t.co/v06Lghvkoq,0
While the #DowJones isn't officially in a #BearMarket its 19.1% decline has already set a record. The Dow dropped 11 out of 12 weeks breaking the record of falling 10 out of 11 weeks back in 1929. That began The Great #Depression. This begins a Greater Inflationary Depression.,1
@robrudolph23 Correct.  When $GBTC traded at a 30% premium I forecast it would eventually fall to a huge discount and why that would be bearish for #Bitcoin,0
@marcoklompx #Bitcoin is a long way from the bottom.,0
@jayp752 My calls have been beautiful for the past year and a half.  Maybe you haven't been paying attention.,0
The discount is 36% now. Looks like margin call related selling.  This could get ugly.,0
Something is definitely going on with The #Grayscale Bitcoin Trust as it's now trading at a new record 35% discount to NAV. Also #Bitcoin isn't participating in the rally in other risk assets. There must be a larger seller of $GBTC which is a bad sign for Bitcoin. Get out now!,1
Bitcoin whales who loaded up on Bitcoin at much lower prices were able to payoff politicians athletes and celebrities to embrace #Bitcoin near the top. That generated enough FOMO to get the public and investors to buy so they could cash out leaving #HODLers holding the bag.,1
@PdinoB I'm not cheering against #Bitcoin. I know it can't work and that its demise is inevitable. I think the sooner people stop buying it the better. I don't want more people to be suckered into loosing more money.,1
Bitcoin bulls got trapped into thinking the market bottomed near $30K only to have the bottom drop out from under them. Now many are making the same mistake at $20K. It's likely they will be fooled again near $10K. Perhaps they'll stop picking bottoms once #Bitcoin breaks $1K.,0
There are two reason that @BarrySilbert will not do this. 1st his selling would likely crash the price of #Bitcoin thus reducing the NAV of $GBTC. 2nd and more important to Barry owing fewer Bitcoin lowers the total NAV of GBTC thus lowering the value of his 2% annual fee.,0
@Kieldro @BarrySilbert $GBTC shares trade at about $12.50. If the discount closed and the price of #BTC remained at $21K GBTC shares would trade near $19. Then shareholders who want out could sell for $19 instead of just $12.50. Then if they want they could use that money to buy actual #Bitcoin.,0
@PULSE_SHANE420 @BarrySilbert Why pay full price for #Bitcoin in the market when they can buy their own shares at a 34% discount?  So instead of buying Bitcoin for $21000 they can buy for just $13860 per Bitcoin. Plus the fund doesn't own much cash it owns Bitcoin.,0
The #Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades at a record 34% discount to NAV. @BarrySilbert why don't you do the right thing by your shareholders and sell some #Bitcoin in the market and use the proceeds to buy back shares until the discount is closed. There's no need to wait for an ETF.,0
May industrial production rose just .2% half the rise expected while factory output fell .1% verses expectations of a .5% gain. Clearly #inflation has already pushed the U.S. #economy into a #recession. Plus lower production means less supply and higher prices. #Stagflation.,0
@_WithAnS @RepThomasMassie Because private businesses raising prices doesn't cause #inflation. Government created inflation causes businesses to raise prices. Rising prices are not inflation. They are the result of inflation. Also there is no price-gouging. Prices are set by supply and demand.,0
This is the month the #Fed was supposed to starting shrinking its balance sheet. Imagine how much weaker the bond market would be if the Fed was selling instead of buying. Meanwhile #Powell talks tough about fighting #inflation in public yet continues to create more in private. https://t.co/beVOsvURZw,0
@LDeeler @BarrySilbert I'm not cherry picking. I'm looking back at when the ad campaign started and prices people likely paid to buy $GBTC after seeing the ads.,0
@kunthaven @BarrySilbert Wait until you see how mad they get next week when #Bitcoin breaks $10K.,1
In May of 2019 #Grayscale launched its drop #gold campaign pumping #Bitcoin and the price of $GBTC up to $17.40 the next month. Today GBTC hit $12.60 down 27.5% (78% below its high at a 33% discount to NAV). Over the same 3 years gold is up over 30%. Any comment @BarrySilbert?,1
The political reality is that the U.S. economy will be in a severe recession during the midterm elections in Nov. and it will still be in the same recession during the general election in 2024. The main difference is that in 2024 #inflation and the #recession will be even worse!,1
Those claiming I've been wrong about #inflation for ten years so I'm just a stopped clock still don't get it. I've been right for ten years. I just warned early. It's those who claimed inflation wasn't a problem or worse that it was too low who've been wrong for ten years!,0
Maybe it's time for #Bitcoin HODLers to remove the laser beams from their eyes. First the laser beams signify holding until $100K. That ain't gonna happen. Second maybe without those laser beams clouding their vision #HOLDers will finally see what they've been missing and sell!,0
"I meant ""given up"" not ""gave up."" I use @Twitter a lot but I hate the fact that typos can't be fixed. Had I caught the mistake sooner I would have deleted the Tweet and started over. @elonmusk if you are dump enough to buy actually buy Twitter at least try to fix this. Thanks.",0
Many people have finally gave up on the idea of a soft landing and now expect a hard landing. But they still don't get it. The only landing possible is a crash where everyone on board dies. That's why the #Fed won't even attempt to land and give up its pretend #inflation fight.,0
FX traders finally realized that the #Fed isn't the only central bank raising interest rates. Since a strong currency is an important part of winning an #inflation fight central banks will now be looking to strengthen not weaken their currencies. That's bad news for the dollar.,0
@AllanLanzador Yes those who made money in #crypto will be sued by those who lost. Same with shameless promoters like @CNBC. Their own clips provide all the evidence any plaintiff attorney needs.,0

I agree with @saylor #Bitcoin is on sale. But I don't agree that it's a buy. The problem is that it's a going-out-of-business sale. Early markdowns are nothing. Just wait until the blowout final markdowns. The closeout sale will be epic. Be careful all sales final. No returns.,0
@NBlakiston Correct and governments and central banks will likely interfere to an even greater degree this time. So it's not looking good.,1
Ever since the #Fed made the mistake of ZIRP &amp; QE I warned it would end in soaring #inflation. People have no idea how bad it will get. Historians will have to come up with a new name for The Great Depression as the inflationary depression we have just entered will be much worse!,0
If the U.S. economy is already in #recession with just 3.6% #unemployment imagine how bad this recession will be once unemployment surges. Soaring #inflation will make the recession much worse as rising prices force even those who don't lose their jobs to cut back on spending.,0
Weekly jobless claims again exceeded expectations and will soon soar as consumers cut back on spending and businesses cut back on workers. June Philly Fed Mfg. fell to -3.3 and May housing starts and building permits collapsed. The home building industry is entering a depression!,1
Average Americians won't get any relief from #inflation until they get relief from government. Until we get serious spending cuts Americans will be on the hook for the cost of big government. If they don't pay with official taxes they'll pay unofficially with the inflation tax!,0
With YoY consumer prices up 9% in the UK the BOE's 25 basis point rate hike today to 1.25% won't provide any relief. Expect UK #inflation to get stronger as the economy gets weaker. Eventually the BOE must stop pretending it's serious about fighting inflation and start fighting.,1
In a very bearish development for stocks the #Swiss National Bank shocked markets by raising interest rates for the first time in 15 years. But with rates still negative at -.25 and official YoY CPI at 2.9% more hikes are coming. If QT follows the #SNB will be dumping stocks!,1

@Mashinsky @CelsiusNetwork When you and I debated #Bitcoin about 6 months ago I pointed out that you must be taking a lot of risk with your deposits to pay such high interest on #crypto. You denied that was the case and assured me and any of your customers who were listening that you didn't take any risk!,0
It took a few days longer than I thought but #Bitcoin came with $80 of $20K and #Ethereum within $20 of $1K. That's a 30% decline in Bitcoin and a 40% decline in Ethereum since this tweet 4 days ago! But the bottom is not in. When these lows are taken out I expect a real crash. https://t.co/DNmfkwMK7V,1
It's interesting that even though most risk assets rose today #Bitcoin and other #cryptos added to recent losses. This confirms an observation I made some time ago. Bitcoin is no longer corollated with tech stocks on the way up only on the way down. There's no reason to own it!,1
There's two problems with Powell's statement. First it's an obvious lie so why tell it? Second the very purpose of raising interest rates to fight #inflation is to change consumer behavior. To get them to spend less. So if #Powell is not lying it means #Fed policy is failing.,0
According to #Powell despite collapsing macro data consumer confidence savings GDP forecasts and personal wealth plus surging food energy shelter interest rates and credit card debt that overall spending remains strong and there's no sign of a broader economic slowdown.,0
#Powell claims the #Fed's goal is to raise interest rates to a more normal level quicker. But #inflation is much higher than normal and rising. With above normal inflation normal interest rates aren't high enough. We have high inflation so we need even higher interest rates!,1
The Atlanta Fed just slashed its estimate for Q2 #GDP growth to zero. In May their estimate was still above 2% and it was revised down to .9% earlier in June. At this rate their next revision will show a negative number officially forecasting a #recession following - 1.5% in Q1.,1
The #Fed made a mistake in waiting too long to raise #InterestRates. It's making another one now but it's not hiking too much but too little. Today's 75 basis point rate hike still isn't enough. Plus the Fed needs more aggressive QT to force the Fed. Govt. to slash spending!,0

Why do so many people fail to understand that a low official #unemployment rate doesn't preclude a #recession? If high #inflation effectively gives 100% of workers a 10% pay cut that could reduce real personal spending as much as 10% of workers losing their jobs. #Stagflation!,0
Disgraceful. @CNBC gave their favorite #Bitcoin pumper @saylor more unchallenged airtime to spread lies about Bitcoin and bash #gold. CNBC even let him get away with bragging that borrowing to buy Bitcoin was the single best investment $MSTR could've made despite being down 30%!,0
Retail sales fell .3% in May as higher prices forced consumers to pay more and buy less. YoY May import prices jumped 11.7% while American made goods prices surged 18.9%. The June Empire State Mfg. Index is minus 1.2. More evidence that #inflation has already caused a #recession.,1
@APompliano You mean restore confidence in the market for #Bitcoin as it would undermine any remanning confidence in the #Fed or the dollar. But confidence in Bitcoin is misplaced. What you really want is for the #Fed to help prolong the delusion so you can sell. Not gonna happen. Sell now.,0

The #ECB caused the sovereign debt crisis in #Europe. But for their reckless Asset Purchase Program #Italy would've been forced to cut government spending sooner. Now their debt is so high that the only politically viable option left may be to exit the EU and return to the lira.,0

Why encourage others to take on debt to buy Bitcoin if you anticipated this type of price collapse? Have you bought more during the collapse?,1
How can anyone long #Bitcoin look at this chart and not sell? Even if you think Bitcoin will ultimately trade higher it's hard to image that it doesn't test long-term support at the lower line first.

If you're bullish on #Bitcoin which I'm definitely not it makes sense to sell your Bitcoin and buy $MSTR. Much more upside if you're right likely the same downside if you're wrong. Also with $GBTC at a 30% discount that's also a better alternative to #BTC for Bitcoin bulls.,0
Since @saylor leveraged $MSTR to buy #Bitcoin there's now a giant hole in MSTR's balance sheet. The current market value of that Bitcoin is 150% of the market cap of the company. If you buy $1 worth of MSTR you get 50 cents worth of Bitcoin and MSTR for free. Not worth the risk!,0
Lee Cooperman was on @CNBC forecasting a long bear market. It will be worse than he thinks. While he expects earning to fall during the #recession he also expects the S&amp;P to trade at 18x earnings. Not only will earnings fall more than he thinks but the PE may bottom below 10x.,0

Imagine parking some free cash in a 30-day T-bill at 2% and then you end up owning a 30-year T-bond yielding 2%. You can either clip those tiny coupons for the next 30 years as #inflation destroys your principal or sell the bond in the market for less than half or what you paid!,0
If the #Fed is serious about bringing #inflation down to 2% one way the Treasury can avoid a technical default would be to extend all maturities on Treasuries to 30 years. That would solve the rollover problem. Treasuries held by the Fed must be exempted to allow QT to continue.,0
@Chalymom Because investors who have no idea what's going on and don't understand what's coming next are selling. But those more astute investors who do understand have been buying. That's what the price of #gold is not much lower.,0
If #Bitcoin can collapse by 70% from $69000 to under $21000 it can just as easily fall another 70% down to $6000. Given the excessive leverage in #crypto imagine the forced sales that would take place during a sell-off of this magnitude. $3000 is a more likely price target.,0
@cryptopl33b Exactly. Many of those workers may own #Bitcoin too which they may have to sell to make ends meet while they are unemployed.,1
#Coinbase is firing 18% of its employees due to falling #crypto prices and #recession. This is likely just the first round of layoffs and a harbinger of many more to come throughout the crypto ecosystem and beyond. Without jobs many #HODLers may be forced to sell their #Bitcoin.,1
An economy that lives by #inflation dies by inflation. Under the guise of ZIRP and QE the #Fed purposely created inflation to artificially stimulate the economy prop up financial markets and enable growing federal budget deficits. What kept the economy alive is now killing it.,1
Obviously the U.S. economy can't survive a 5% 10-year Treasury let alone 6%. At 5% the annual interest payments on the National Debt alone will exceed $1 trillion. That's more than triple the expected cost of Build Back Better only nothing will be built! The Fed can't allow it.,0
@NgouRod You would think so. It's hard to imagine 4% 10-year Treasuries and 6.5% mortgages not crashing the stock and many real estate markets making the recession that much more obvious to everyone including the #Fed.,1
@JasonNoll4 #Gold is not crashing. The price is still about $1800 about unchanged for the year. But I agree the price should be much higher. I think by year-end it will be.,1
@bikramjitbhawal Why real rates will still be negative? They may be even more negative than they are now. But if the #Fed actually allows rates to get this high the economy will be in a severe recession with high unemployment. So it will restart QE in an effort to bring nominal rates back down.,1
Back in Mar. I warned that if the #Fed didn't pivot 10-year Treasury yields would hit 5% by year-end. Well it hasn't and we may hit 5% by the end of summer. If so 30-year mortgage rates will top 7.5%. By year-end we could be dealing with a 6% 10-year and 8.5% 30-year mortgage! https://t.co/XeONoEvpVp,1

EV start-up Electric Last Mile Solutions to declare bankruptcy after going public through a SPAC in Sept. of last year. $ELMS went from IPO to BK in less than a year. The IPO price was $10. Last is 19 cents. This is likely the first of many money-losing IPOs soon to go bankrupt.,0
Even if the #Fed's proposed interest rate hikes were enough to successfully reduce #inflation to 2% it will take years before consumers get any relief. Meanwhile the pain of higher rates will be felt immediately and will exact a heavy toll on the economy and financial markets.,1
U.S. investors are still clueless as to how much wealth they are about to lose. If the #Fed fights #inflation for real stocks bonds and real estate crash companies go bankrupt and bonds go into default including Treasuries. If it doesn't investors get decimated by inflation.,0
Listening to so-called financial experts comment on what they think the #Fed got wrong and what it should do now are both comical and sad. The level of economic ignorance is shocking especially when it comes to #inflation what it is where it comes from and how to control it.,1
Despite the carnage in the #StockMarket both bond yields and #oil prices are up today. This clearly indicates that while the #Fed has already succeeded in causing a #recession and bear market it has not succeeded in slowing #inflation. How long before investors figure this out?,1

The #Fed is correct. Price controls don't work. They also don't work for interest rates. When the Fed sets interest rates instead of allowing the free market to discover the appropriate interest rate it leads to an inefficient allocation of credit. https://t.co/i6sSCuYMNt,0

@Dark_Matters_11 @saylor Not the same. You can't make any jewelry with just one molecule of #gold. Let's say you need 100 grams of gold to make a particular gold chain. 1 gram of gold is not enough. But you can't make anything out of Sats no matter how many you have. So #Bitcoin quantity is meaningless.,0
@JackHat11232815 @saylor No there's not. There are 100 cents per dollar. Originally those cents represented a quantity of copper. The more you had the more copper you had to make stuff with.,0
@saylor #Bitcoin isn't scarce. There's 2.1 quadrillion Sats. Plenty for everyone. Since you can't do anything more with an arbitrary bundle of 100 million Sats than you can with one there's no reason to own more than one. Plus there's nearly 20K other worthless tokens to choose from.,0
@oahumada Excellent time to sell #Bitcoin. You can always buy back in at lower prices if you want. My advice is don't buy back in with the same dollar amount. Just buy back the same quantity and take some money off the table to reduce your risk. Maybe buy some #gold with that extra cash.,0
@stacksats42069 I agree. $800 billion is still a lot of market value for $20K worthless digital tokens. So $800 billion will just be a stop on the road to 0.,1
@_Memorious_ #Bitcoin is not even a financial asset. It's a collectable digital token.,0

This could be a rough weekend for #crypto. #Bitcoin looks poised to crash to $20K and #Ethereum to $1K. If so the entire market cap of nearly 20K digital tokens would sink below $800 billion from nearly $3 trillion at its peak. Don't buy this dip. You'll lose a lot more money.,0

#Inflation is running out of control stocks and bonds are tanking and @CNBC doesn't invite a single guest on their air to recommend #gold which rose $24 today. Instead they invite my friend @APompliano and others to pump #Bitcoin which is teetering on a cliff about to crash.,0
Pres. @JoeBiden keeps lying. He falsely blamed #inflation on #Putin greedy foreign owned shipping companies and domestic #oil companies. He also falsely claims families have more savings and less debt than when he took office and that the U.S. economy is the world's strongest.,1
@Spencer56049611 We likely need the federal government to balance the budget and the Fed to liquidate most of its balance sheet and let interest rates find their natural level.,1
Even if the #Fed were to raise interest rates by 75 basis points next week it won't be effective in weakening #inflation which will continue to get stronger. But it will accelerate weakness in both financial markets and the economy. That's why the Fed probably won't do it.,1
Fed members insist they'll bring #inflation back down to 2%. In reality most FOMC members will not live long enough to see a year when the #CPI only rises by 2%. Those days are long gone. We are reaping the whirlwind of the inflationary winds the #Fed sowed when it launched QE1.,0
The most important mistake investors are making is thinking that a #recession will solve the #inflation problem. In reality it will make it worse. When the #Fed pivots and launches QE5 to stimulate the economy the dollar will tank accelerating the increase in consumer prices.,0
@IamTheChanger99 That's a bad idea considering how many predictions I have made that have already come true!,0
The Treasury yield curve finally inverted from 5s to 30s indicating investors realize higher #inflation means the #Fed will start cutting rates sooner to stimulate an economy in #recession. They still don't realize that it's inflation not the economy that will be stimulated.,0
If consumer confidence is at a record low now imagine how much lower it will sink if the #Fed actually fights #inflation. Consumers will lose their #jobs watch their stock and bond portfolios collapse home equity vanish taxes raised benefits cut and debt service costs soar.,1
High #inflation caused June Consumer Confidence to collapse to 50.2 the lowest ever. Lower than during the 2008 Financial Crisis and lower than during the Covid lockdowns. If the #Fed and the Govt. actually do what's necessary to fight inflation confidence will tank even lower.,0
To be bearish on #gold one must believe the #Fed will raise interest rates high enough to vanquish #inflation but not high enough to cause a #recession. In reality the reverse is true. The Fed will hike rates enough to cause a recession but not nearly enough to beat inflation!,0
@johnnyboyza Correct. I should have specified that. The pandemic was the reason for the lockdowns but they didn't have to happend. They were yet another mistake made by governments.,0
@jewla8 @bitsovryn Shutting down the economy is what hurt. The #Fed tried to reduce the pain by printing a lot of money. It worked for a while but at the expense of increasing future pain. Welcome to the future. It's going to get much worse. You can thank the Fed.,0
@Abbas62413663 Because they should have reduced the money supply to match the reduction in the supply of goods including food and fuel. But they did the opposite. The result is soaring prices.,0
The #Fed caused high #inflation not supply shortages beyond its control. The proper monetary policy response to the reduced supply caused by the pandemic would've been to reduce demand by reducing the money supply. Instead the Fed increased demand by increasing the money supply.,0
Clearly #inflation didn't peak. The #CPI spiked 1% in May and rose 8.6% YoY a new cycle high. But if measured properly the real YoY rate is closer to 20% the highest ever. Since the #Fed continues to fuel the inflation fire consumers will feel the heat as it gets much hotter.,1
@commando520 I know what it should do. But it's hard to know for sure what it will do. But regardless of which way #gold goes tomorrow it's ultimately headed much higher. So if it goes down it's a buying opportunity.,1
Gold mining stocks are unlikely casualties of #inflation which increased the cost of mining gold much more than the price of #gold. That's because naive investors believe central banks can easily vanquish inflation without causing a #recession. So they're not hedging with gold.,0
Pres. @JoeBiden claims #Trump moved the #Republican Party hard right. But Trump increased government spending ran up the national debt imposed protective tariffs that resulted in larger trade deficits and demanded the #Fed print more money. In reality both parties moved left!,1

Investors are worried that rising #inflation means the #Fed will have to fight harder to contain it pushing the U.S. economy into #recession. As a result they're selling stocks. If investors realized inflation will win the fight they'd also be selling dollars and buying #gold.,1
Yields on 5-year U.S. Treasuries just hit a new high and are once again above the yield on 10-year Treasuries. This indicates that investors are waking up to the reality of #recession. But a lack on interest in #gold indicates they are still asleep to the reality of #inflation.,1

The #ECB's decision not to raise interest rates to raise them by just .25% in July and to continue to expand its bloated balance sheet by reinvesting all interest and maturing principal payments means that Eurozone #inflation already at record highs is headed much higher.,0

People accuse me of being mean for advocating higher taxes on the middle class. I'm not mean I'm honest. I prefer spending cuts. But elected officials must level with voters. If voters want big government but don't want high #inflation they must pay for it with higher taxes!,0
@durtyd45 @LizClaman That's my preference. But if the government refuses to cut spending that's the only option that left.,0
@Chalks1972 @LizClaman Yes. If the government refuses to cut spending it must raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it. Otherwise the middle class will pay for it with even more #inflation. It's not what I want. I prefer spending cuts. But one or both must happend or inflation will get worse.,0

@runridefly There's no historical relationship between the price of #Bitcoin and the price of anything including #oil. Bitcoin isn't a commodity so its price has no relationship to the price of any commodity. It has no real value on its own or relative to anything else. That's the problem!,0
One ounce of #gold now buys just 15 barrels of #oil. Historically this means either oil is expensive or gold is cheap. Since the price of oil is likely to keep rising from here it's more likely the latter. A major gold rally is long overdo and can begin at any moment. Get ready!,0

@KartikGadaATOM Oil only briefly spiked to $140 in 2008 then crashed back down to about $30 by year end due to the GFC. But gas prices at the pump are already much higher than they were in 2008. This time consumers won't be saved by a financial crisis. This rise is permanent and will continue.,0
With all the talk about peak #inflation the price of #oil is above $120 per barrel registering its highest weekly close since just prior to the 2008 Financial Crisis. I wonder how many people will still be talking about peak inflation when oil prices hit $150 over the summer!,1

@Linda_Bass_ Well prior to the 1970s men were able to support their families. Higher taxes and inflation in the 1970s made that impossible. Thankfully women were there to pick up the slack. But now that women and men or working whose left? Maybe kids drop out of school and start working too.,0
Two ways the U.S. kept a lid on consumer prices since the 1970s apart from lying about how much they were rising was women entering the workforce and outsourcing our manufacturing to #China. Since we can no longer rely on those crutches now #inflation will cripple the economy.,0
People keep talking about all the progress the #Fed is making in fighting #inflation. Yet all the evidence ($119 #oil) shows that the Fed is now further behind the curve than it's ever been. It's dragging its feet on rate hikes and QT while inflation gets further out of control.,1
It should be obvious that the #Fed will not be able to shrink its balance sheet as planned. Doing so would require the Federal Government to pass significant spending cuts or tax increases. Since no such fiscal proposals are under consideration a return to QE is not too far off.,0
Pres. @JoeBiden is wrong. The U.S. can't fight #inflation from a position of strength. Thanks to the #Fed and policies of his and prior administrations the U.S. economy has never been in a weaker position to handle an inflation fight. We have more debt and bigger asset bubbles.,1

@CurtFinch I think there were lots of variables. But the dollar being the world's reserve currency helped the U.S. export a lot of its #inflation and receive real consumer goods in exchange. Those exported dollars propped up asset prices and suppressing both the #CPI and interest rates.,1
#Inflation ignorance is staggering. The #Fed has been creating massive inflation for years under the guise of QE. It's just that for the first decade the inflation mainly showed up in asset prices. But as I warned from the beginning it would ultimately end up in consumer prices.,0
@ZachJones0509 Well there perspective is what counts especially if they take action based on it. The U.S. depends more on China than any other nation. It's never smart to bite the hand that feeds you or in this case supplies you with lots of low-priced consumer goods on credit.,1

#TerraUSD has crashed below 40¬¢. The collapse exposes a critical flaw in #Bitcoin. #Luna can't sell enough Bitcoin from its reserves to stabilize #UST at 1$ due to a lack of real liquidity in Bitcoin. Doing so would crash the market destroying the value of its Bitcoin reserves.,0

@Longterm44 Inflation isn't even close to peaking. The only reason gold is not soaring is that investors are foolish enough to think the Fed can bring the rate back down to 2% without creating a recession let alone the greater financial crisis that is guaranteed to result.,0

So far 80% of the 16000 #Bitcoin owners who responded to my poll believe that Bitcoin will fall below $30k. Given the current price of $34.5k why not sell and buy back after the drop especially if you can also book a tax loss?,0
I left out the option of buying the dip. I'll assume many HODLers will do this until they run out of money. Bad decision.,0
If #Bitcoin breaks decisively below $30K it seems highly likely that it will crash below $10K. That means anyone who owns Bitcoin now has a very important decision to make. What will you do? You had better decide now so you don't panic and make a rash spur-of-the-moment decision.,1
@empatik Well I've been twitting about #Bitcoin the entire way down from almost $70K. So far buying my tweets has been a losing strategy.,0

@midwestspecs I agree. Women should have a right to do whatever they want with their own bodies including many things that are now illegal under state and federal law. But when it comes to abortion there are two lives to consider. So it's not as simple.,1
When it comes to #abortion the key #Constitution issue isn't a woman's right to choose but when life begins and when the unborn themselves are endowed with Constitutional rights. As the Constitution is silent on this distinction it's therefore up to individual states to make it.,1

@GradeAMuzik @APompliano Eventually it will but there are a lot of die hards that will keep buying so it will likely take many years for the price to get that low.,1
@APompliano True but an asteroid large enough to kill us all hitting the earth is an extremely low probability event. On the other hand #Bitcoin trading below $10K is pretty much a sure thing. The only variable is when.,0
#Bitcoin is coming under pressure again. Now that it's failed to hold $36K it's looking to form new support at $35K. If it fails there I think $33K will be the next challenge. If that fails the next stop is $30K. If that level fails look out below. Bitcoin will crash below $10K.,0

Mar. consumer credit exploded¬†by a record $52.435 billion with credit card debt soaring by a record $31.4 billion as #inflation forced consumers to take on more debt to make ends meet. The fact that higher interest rates has resulted in more not less borrowing proves just...,0
The talking heads on @CNBC agree with @DavidTepper5 that markets sold off because #Powell took a 75 basis point rate hike off the table. Had Powell left it on the table the markets would have sold off immediately instead of a day later. Even the smart money still doesn't get it.,0
It's curious that #Bitcoin has held up so well around the $36K level. My guess is there is a concerted effort by large holders to prop up the price. Judging by the continued carnage in every stock related to #crypto perhaps whales are selling those stocks to buy more Bitcoin.,1

@yaboytcell @saylor Well they hold gold inside them as they make the chips work. #Gold actually has utility. #Bitcoin has none.,0
@saylor It's a complete waste of energy. But that doesn't mean it should be banned. People have a right to waste energy as long as they are willing to pay for it. But the world would be much better off without squandering scarce resources on a pyramid scheme.,0
I remember how strong #StockMarket pundits and economists thought the U.S. economy was right before the 2008 Financial Crisis even though we were already in The Great Recession at the time. It wasn't strong it was a bubble about to pop. Today's economy is an even bigger bubble!,1
The #Fed's balance sheet actually rose slightly last week. Despite that rise bonds still got killed. Imagine how much worse the carnage will be once the Fed starts QT. In fact it's unlikely the Fed will ever get to its planned $95K per month reduction. It will likely restart QE!,1
@SovereignBTCer @APompliano The price of gold today reflects the use value of gold as a metal from now until the end of time as gold is eternal.  Most commodities have short shelf lives.,1

@APompliano So what happens to #Bitcoin when they are finished buying? Then what happens to Bitcoin if they start selling?,0
@TestingRhymes Abolish the #Fed. Return to the #gold standard. Allow companies to go bankrupt and debts to go into default. Give governments no choice but to slash spending and reduce regulations. Let the free market solve the problems the government and the Fed caused.,0
The media is wrong to conclude the markets are doubting the #Fed can engineer a soft landing. The markets realize the Fed will have to fight harder to battle #inflation. If markets understood that a massive recession already started the dollar would be falling and #gold soaring.,0
#Unemployment is about to soar as lots of people not in the labor force will be forced to enter. Younger people who've made money trading meme #stocks and #crypto will have to get jobs and older people decimated by #inflation will have to come out of retirement to make ends meet.,1
#Bitcoin #crypto &amp; #blockchain related stocks are getting decimated. Many of these companies will go bankrupt as the entire industry is exposed as malinvestment. Mass layoffs will result in mass selling of crypto as unemployed workers raise cash to pay soaring household bills.,0
$GBTC is trading at more than a 25% discount to NAV. Why are shareholders so desperate to sell their #Bitcoin that they're willing to accept such a huge discount? Why buy Bitcoin directly when you can buy GBTC and get 35% more Bitcoin for your dollars? Bitcoin is about to crash!,0
@Chief_Diversity I've been right over the past 13 years. We are only now just starting to find out how right I was.  It's just that everyone else got it so wrong. That's why they're still so clueless as to what's actually happening.,0
The #recession that we are already in will be much worse than the Great Recession that followed the 2008 Financial Crisis. In addition to double digit #inflation the economy will be hit by mass layoffs as reduced consumer spending forces money-losing companies to slash payrolls.,0

The #Fed created the 2008 financial crisis by keeping interest rates too low. Then it swept its mess under a rug of #inflation. Now that the inflation chickens it released are coming home to roost it must create an even greater financial crisis to clean up an even bigger mess!,0

Bond prices are plunging as yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries break 3.15% the highest since Dec. of 2018. #Bonds are not pricing in future rate hikes as most believe but higher #inflation. Crashing productivity and a dovish pivot provide a wakeup call to slumbering vigilantes!,1
@Bodhi_Trades I tweet about that too.  In fact my next tweet will likely be about bonds.,1
@Splash_IZ The #Fed needs to shrink the money supply along with the reduction in the supply of goods. That will force drastic cuts in spending by individuals and government as well as much lower asset prices. Interest rates also have to be allowed to rise well above the #inflation rate.,1
Not only can't the #Fed win a fight against #inflation without causing a #recession it can't do so without causing a far worse financial crisis than the one we had in 2008. Worse still a war against inflation can't be won if there are any bailouts or stimulus to ease the pain!,0
U.S. Q1 non-farm labor productivity crashed 7.5% the most since 1947 as unit labor costs soared 11.6%. But higher labor costs didn't translate into higher real wages which tumbled 5.5%. Since consumer prices are a function of productivity #inflation is about to get much worse!,1

Why is the #Fed raising interest rates so slowly? If it thinks a 2.5% Fed Funds rate is appropriate why not just move rates to that level right now? If rates are too low the longer they remain too low the more damage they will do to the economy. #Inflation has already won!,0
#Powell continues to talk about the U.S. economy being strong completely ignoring the 1.4% decline in Q1 #GDP which will likely be revised to an even greater decline due to the higher than expected trade deficit reported today. Also higher interest rates mean Q2 will be worse!,1
#Powel defined a neutral rate as being 2%-3% in an economy with 2% #inflation. But we are not in an economy with 2% inflation. We have official inflation of 9% and actually inflation much higher than that. Yet Powell refuses to state what's neutral in our high-inflation economy!,1
Today @JoeBiden bragged about cutting the budget deficit he inherited from #Trump. He compared the $2.8T 2021 deficit to the $3.1T 2020 deficit. But a 10% decline relative the 2020 spike is irrelevent. The 2021 post Covid deficit is almost triple the $980B 2019 pre-Covid deficit!,1
Why do people insist the #inflation we have today is not as bad as the inflation of the 1970s when it's actually worse when measured using the same #CPI? Worse still is that now we have much more debt. So this inflation fight will do far more collateral damage to the #economy!,0
The U.S. trade deficit swelled 22.3% in March to a new monthly record high of $109.8 billion. Imports jumped 10.3% while exports rose just 5.6% less than the official #inflation rate. Even the trade deficit with #Russia surged to an 11-year high. The dollar crash will be brutal.,1
The #Fed is not raising interest rates to slow down the economy. The economy has already stalled and is likely in a #recession. The Fed is raising rates to fight #inflation. But the hikes are too little too late to do the job. But they're enough to weaken an already weak economy!,0

The #Fed is confident that this time it can raise interest rates without causing a recession as the economy is so much stronger now than it was in the past. A negative 1.4% Q1 #GDP provides more evidence that the economy has never been weaker when the Fed began raising rates!,1
As I've been warning Q1 #GDP just revealed a U.S. economy that's half way to an official recession. Q1 GDP was negative 1.4% verses expectations of a 1.1% rise. If the economy is this week with interest rates this low the next few rate hikes will push the economy into #recession!,0

@SovereignBTCer @d1g1tal_n0m4d @djccryptoninja @saylor @SECGov The intrinsic value of #gold is its use as a metal and its unique and valuable properties that other metals don't share. That distinguishes gold from fiat currency or #Bitcoin which have no intrinsic value.,0
@d1g1tal_n0m4d @djccryptoninja @saylor @SECGov I didn't start the rumors. In fact Saylor addressed the rumors before I even noticed they were circulating.,0
@djccryptoninja @saylor @SECGov I didn't ask Saylor to make sure disclosures. Just to confirm or deny rumors that either $MSTR or he had sold any #Bitcoin. He is publicly telling others to take on debt rather than sell any Bitcoin even mortgage their houses. I am just curious if he is following his own advice.,0
@saylor @SECGov Thanks for trying to clarify the rumors but I'm still a bit confused. Are you saying that $MSTR hasn't sold any of its #Bitcoin? Is there an SEC rule that would require disclosure if it did? If so can you cite it? Also have you sold any of the Bitcoin that you own personally?,0
@NikaKhabu @runcandice @saylor Again I have not accused him. I am asking others what they think. Saylor has been saying some really crazy stuff about ##Bitcoin lately. Over-the-top nonsense. So after reading several articles on the topic I was curious what others thought. Saylor has been silent on this topic.,0
@RizayW @saylor Here is one. There are more. https://t.co/5rBqpqWGI6,1
@runcandice @saylor I'm not accusing him of doing anything. I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. I've been falsely accused myself. I am just asking what others think about these rumors. Maybe there is more information out there to either support or refute them.,0
@5meoBTC @saylor Just google Saylor. The articles will come up.,0
I've been reading some articles about @saylor pumping and secretly dumping his #Bitcoin. While this is certainly the smart thing to do it's highly unethical and given his position at  #MicroStrategy may even be illegal.  I wonder if there is any truth to these rumors. Thoughts?,1

@KoyaPotentdream @BillAckman Depends on how long he waits to sell.  But yes he will likely get out with a profit. So he was wrong but will likely still make money.,0
Hedge fund manager @BillAckman admitted his mistake and sold #Netflix to cut his losses. I think Paul Tudor Jones will do the same with #Bitcoin. He was mistaken to think Bitcoin would be the fastest horse in the #inflation hedge race. Time to retire Bitcoin to the glue factory.,1
In Q4 of 2018 despite signs of a slowing economy the #Fed indicated it would keep hiking interest rates and shrinking its balance sheet. When the #StockMarket crashed the Fed reversed course. The stock market is poised to crash again. This time the Fed claims it doesn't care.,0
Yesterday #Powell claimed the hot labor market is great for workers. Today GAP stock is down 20% (70% below its 2021 high) because those workers' paychecks have been so eviscerated by #inflation that after paying for rent food and energy there's nothing leftover to buy clothes!,1
At this point it's impossible for the #Fed to get it right as it already got it completely wrong and it's gotten it wrong for years. Instead of worrying about future mistakes the Fed might make investors must come to terms with horrific past mistakes the Fed has already made.,0
If the #Fed can do this much damage to the markets just by talking about raising interest rates and shrinking its balance sheet image what will happen if it actually does it. Then imagine what will happen when investors find out it's not enough to meaningfully reduce #inflation!,0
The #Fed is not hawkish. At this point all it's doing is talking and what it's talking about doing is not aggressive. If the Fed was serious about fighting #inflation it would not still be pulling its punches. Rates would already be much higher and its balance sheet much smaller!,0

@schnieder_jeff #Bitcoin is risk on. #Gold is risk off. GDX is a different kind of risk.,0
Yes #gold stocks got clobbered today with the GDX down 5% on a mere $6 drop in the price of gold. But since Feb. 10th the GDX is up 25%. In contrast The Valkyrie #Bitcoin Miners ETF is down 35%. $10K invested in gold miners = $12.5K. $10K invested in fool's gold miners = $6.5K!,1
#Powell claims we have a very hot labor market that's great for workers. The only thing hot is #inflation. The #Fed lit that fire and now worker's paychecks are burning. Nominal wages are rising but the cost of living is rising much faster. This is a historic crash in real wages!,1
@worden_van Yes #gold stocks are climbing a wall of worry. Rising interest rates are shaking out weak hands who have no clue what is actually happening. Smart money is buying this dip.,0
"At today's #IMF roundtable #Fed Chair #Powell was asked ""If the economy starts to slow materially will you stop tightening even if #inflation is still above your target?"" Powell dodged that question because any answer he gave would have caused pandemonium in financial markets.",1
@kycdeez There is no such thing as a cheap sat. Any price above zero is expensive!,0
@notthreadguy I don't own any Netflix shares.,0
#Coinbase is down another 7% so far today hitting a new all-time low of $136.08. That represent a 63% decline from its Nov. 2021 high. In fact every stock related to #crypto is getting killed. This is a leading indicator of carnage to come in #Bitcoin and over 19000 #altcoins.,1
@ExplainThisBot @DzikaBomba1916 You have it backwards. It makes it easier for them to find jobs as more jobs become legally available.,1
A major reason for the fall in #unemployment is a historic collapse in the real minimum wage. As #inflation drives the real minimum wage lower labor demand rises. The productivity of many low-skilled workers now exceeds the minimum wage making those workers legally employable!,0
Many claim real yields on 10-year Treasuries briefly turned positive Tues. But that's only true if bond investors benign expectation that #inflation averages 2.9% over the next 10 years comes true. Bond investors still have confidence in the #Fed. They're in for a rude awakening!,1

#Netflix is down 26% after hours and 63% below last year's high after losing subscribers for the first quarter ever and projecting an even larger subscriber loss this quarter. Why is this a surprise? Customers have more choices and less discretionary income to split among them.,0
When 30-year Treasury yields were 3% in April 2019 the official YoY #inflation rate was 1.8% and falling. Real yields were positive 1.2%. Today the official YoY inflation rate is 8.5% and rising. Real yields are negative 5.5%. To equal 1.2% real nominal yields must rise to 9.7%!,1
Oof! That Didn't Age Well! @schiffgold https://t.co/15aJw5pWve,1
When the BOJ is forced to aggressively raise interest rates to fight #inflation it won't just create a financial crisis in Japan but it will set into motion a far greater crisis in the U.S. as interest rates will spike world-wide. The U.S. economy and dollar are most vulnerable!,0
The Japanese yen has already fallen by 12% against the dollar so far this year. But as the Japanese rush to dump their JGBs to escape further real losses the BOJ has committed to unlimited yen printing to buy them. That means Japan is about to get hit by an #inflation tsunami.,1
When 30-year Treasury yields hit 5% 30-year mortgage rates will likely exceed 7.5%. What will happen to housing and financial markets and the economy with mortgage rates that high? Think about all the 5/1 ARMs that will reset. Where will homeowners get the extra cash to pay?,1
The yield on 30-year U.S. Treasuries just hit 3%. If you think this is the peak think again. Without a #Fed pivot and QE5 30-year Treasury yields will likely hit 5% before year-end. But 5% won't be the peak either as even at that nominal rate real yields will still be negative!,1
Don't misinterpret the unexpected rise in housing starts and building permits as being indicative of a stong housing market. All the gains were in multi-family rental units as single family declined. As more families are priced out of homeownership renting is their only option!,1

@Handrev Yes eventually.,1
Despite #gold and #silver prices rising today with gold touching $2K most gold and silver mining stocks closed lower as metals sold off from their early morning highs. These stocks are climbing a classic wall of worry as any price decline sends traders running for the exits.,1
@reelgoodman @zerohedge It's hurting it but not killing it. Our foreign stock accounts all have solid gains so far this year even with the headwind of a strong dollar.  I expect that headwind to become a tailwind by year-end.,1
@zerohedge Eventually #Bitcoin will plummet by the same magnitude. None of this stuff has any real value.,0

#Bitcoin was able to hold above $40K all weekend until equities and #gold resumed trading. Since NASDAQ futures are down over 1% and gold is up $15 trading just under $1990 Bitcoin naturally followed tech stocks lower and maintained its perfect inverse correlation with gold.,1

This week's Friday Gold Wrap podcast. https://t.co/ITvBBfbd7R,0
In the week ended April 13th the Fed's balance sheet expanded by another $27.9 billion hitting a new high of $8.965 trillion. For all the talk of fighting #inflation and shirking its balance sheet the #Fed continues creating more inflation and expanding its balance sheet!,1
More Inflation Pain: Producer Prices Chart Biggest Increase Ever @schiffgold https://t.co/z0KhDCBVsz,1
@hiperakuziETH @elonmusk You haven't followed very long. I've been right about a lot of things.,1
@greg16676935420 @elonmusk #Gold bars are far more acceptable as payment than either #Dogecoin or #Bitcoin especially for payments this large.,0
@MarkOwe19668251 @elonmusk Yes but most of his wealth in invested in two stocks. I don't think he will dump those positions and crash the market to overpay for Twitter and it's too risky to borrow the money risking a margin call especially with interest rates rising and high PE stocks falling.,1
@elonmusk I agree. But I think the board should call your bluff and accept your offer. I don't think you have the intention or the liquidity to buy #Twitter and I don't think the board will accept payment in #Dogecoin.,1
@ZoomPianoTutor True and when they see how much money they are losing on their 40% bond allocation they will sell all of their bonds.,1
The reason bond yields are rising nearly every day is that so few people are willing to buy. But the Treasury is selling record quantities. The #Fed isn't buying so private investors won't lend for less than #inflation. So bonds will keep falling until real yields are positive!,1
I forgot that the bond market is closed tomorrow for Good Friday. So 3% yields will not arrive until Monday. Maybe we will get a stock market crash too.,1
The yields on 10 and 30-year U.S. Treasuries are now above 2.8% and 2.9% respectively. Rates could top 3% tomorrow and the #Fed has yet to raise the target Fed Funds rate above .25% - .50%. The last time yields on long #bonds exceeded 3% the target Fed Funds rate was 2.25%-2.5%!,1
The dollar is rising against the euro because the #Fed is still pretending it will fight #inflation while the #ECB is still pretending inflation is transitory. Once both banks stop pretending the dollar will fall against the euro but both currencies will collapse against #gold!,1
The #ECB announced interest rates will stay at zero until it judges #inflation will stabilize at 2% over the medium term. Eurozone inflation is currently 7.5%. How will throwing more gasoline on a fire put it out? Europeans are stuck with inflation well above 2% indefinitely!,1
Mar. retail sales rose 6.9% YoY the least since Feb. of 2021. But online sales plunged 6.4% on the month and are up just 1.8% YoY. Retail sales are not adjusted for #inflation so they're actually collapsing as consumers paying more for rent food and gas cut back on shopping.,0
According to the government March consumer prices rose by 8.5% YoY. Consumer prices are composed of the prices we pay for the stuff we import and they stuff we produce ourselves. But Mar. YoY import prices rose 12.5% and export prices rose 18.8%. That's an average rise of 15.65%!,1
March import prices surged 2.6% on the month and 12.5% YoY while export prices exploded 4.5% on the month and 18.8% YoY. Since the latter is more reflective of domestic cost it's a far more accurate measure of U.S. #inflation than the 8.5% revealed by a highly manipulated #CPI.,1

@JeppesenRj The only thing I'm short is bonds. I'm very long equities. Most of my holdings keeping hitting new highs. I've been preparing for #inflation for years and now those investments are really starting to pay off.,0
The U.S. economy was weakened not strengthened by Covid. It's also far more indebted post Covid than before. If they #Fed had to abort rate hikes and QT in 2018 due to their effects on the economy why does it think a more aggressively tightening policy now will do less damage?,0
Fed Governor Waller claims this time it'll be easy for the #Fed to successfully fight #inflation without hurting the economy as the economy is so much stronger now than in the past. In reality America's bubble economy has never been more vulnerable to a rise in interest rates!,1

@deimos1999 @CNBC Yes I thought it was a new low even for Liesman.,0
Producer #prices rose another 1.4% in March. The YoY rise is 11.2%. Since YoY consumer prices only rose by 8.5% businesses are still eating a lot of cost increases that will soon be passed on to their customers. This means future #CPI increases will be much greater when they do!,1
@firedfiat @CNBC No Steve Liesman blocked me a long time ago.,0

üî¥ Peak Inflation Is Wishful Thinking - Ep 799
https://t.co/nzgHpWnCfB https://t.co/nzgHpWnCfB",1
It looks like #Bitcoin couldn't hold $40K after all. Too bad @CNBC. HODLers had better hope for better luck at $30K otherwise it's a long way down. #Coinbase making a new all-time low and closing below $150 per share is not a good sign for the future of #crypto. Wake up sheeple!,0
YoY core #CPI makes no sense. The reason economists look at monthly core and not the headline number is to smooth out short-term volatility in monthly changes. But if food &amp; energy prices rise YoY it's not volatility it's a trend. So YoY the headline number is all that matters!,1
If #inflation is Putin's fault why is core CPI up? A 6.5% rise is still more than triple the Fed's 2% target and has nothing to do with #Putin. With people spending more on food &amp; energy they should have less to spend on other goods sending those prices lower. The #Fed did this!,0
The yield curve is no longer inverted at any point. 5s are higher than 2s 10s are higher than 5s &amp; 30s are higher than 10s with 30s the only maturity higher on the day. This means investors are pricing in a #recession starting sooner and #inflation lasting longer. #Stagflation!,1
Peter Schiff: March Madness in the Bond Market https://t.co/D4jthkHO8z,1
https://t.co/p5pVIOV73z https://t.co/p5pVIOV73z,0
Markets are pricing in #Fed rate hikes peaking at 3.25% in 2023. But since official #inflation will be above 4% throughout the end of 2023 negative rates will be ineffective in fighting inflation. Plus long before 3.25% is reached recession will result in rate cuts and more QE!,1
The 8.5% YoY gain in March #CPI is the highest since 1981 when interest rates were 20% &amp; CPI was 13.5%. Current interest rates are .25% and using the 1981 CPI the YoY gain is likely 17%. With real rates negative 16.75% now verses positive 6.5% then #inflation is here to stay.,0
Investors are relieved that the 1.2% jump in the March #CPI or the 8.5% YoY surge the biggest gain in forty years wasn't worse. The actual rate is likely 17%! They are also taking false comfort in the less than expected .3% monthly and 6.5% YoY rise excluding food and energy.,0
@PunksMoon @CNBC Those gains are meaningless to the 50% of #Bitcoin owners who didn't buy until last year in large part due to CNBC's constant pumping!,1
The #Bitcoin coverage on @CNBC is so biased due to their crypto advertisers and parade of industry shills that today's coverage is focused on the meaningless fact that Bitcoin has recovered back above $40K rather than its 16% drop over the past two weeks or its 38% YoY plunge!,1
@teslaownersSV @elonmusk I would much rather have #SpaceX plant a flag on mars than the U.S. government.  At least SpaceX will spend its own money getting there and do so efficiently and not ask me to pay for it with either higher taxes or #inflation.,0
Those who claimed QE wouldn't cause #inflation were right. QE doesn't cause inflation QE is inflation. But QE does cause prices to rise. It's just that there can be a long lag between QE and big price increases. That's why so many still don't make the connection between the two!,0
@elonmusk @LPofMN The government is the winner as it spends the newly printed money into circulation. So purchasing power is transferred from the public to the government. Plus when the government inflates the money supply it wipes out the real value of its debt which is also owed to the public.,1
Attention #Bitcoin HODLers. It's not too late to sell your Bitcoin and buy #gold.  But don't wait too long as it soon will be!,0
To clarify this Tweet a 2.5% interest rate is only stimulative for #inflation. It's not stimulative for the U.S. economy as it's so over-leveraged with debt that though 2.5% would be stimulative for a healthy economy it's not stimulative enough for our sick economy. Stagflation!,0
The #Fed claims it will fight #inflation by raising interest rates to a neutral rate of 2.25% - 2.5% by year-end. But you can't fight inflation by being neutral. It requires tight money. Plus 2.5% is not a neutral interest rate with an 8% inflation rate. It's highly stimulative!,1
...rates at zero 4. With so large a balance sheet 5. With such an over-leverage economy 6. With Federal budget deficits this large 5. With trade deficits this large. 6. With assets so over-priced. Therefore the impending economic &amp; financial crisis will also be unprecedented!,0
Past #inflation fights are irrelevent to assessing the potential damage from the current fight which is without precedent. The #Fed has never started an inflation fight: 1. This far behind the inflation curve 2. With real interest rates so negative 3. With nominal interest...,0
Now that it's obvious from its negative correlation to gold that #Bitcoin is not digital #gold Bitcoin pumpers are rebranding Bitcoin this time as digital equity. Bitcoin is highly correlated to tech stocks only with a higher beta and no risk of missing on earnings or revenue!,0
There's now more than 18800 #crypto currencies. If #Bitcoin was all its promoters claim there would be no crypto industry just a Bitcoin industry. #Tether is in 3rd place by market cap with a 20% lead over #BNB. But if they keep counterfeiting more it will eventually take 1st!,0
CNBC just aired a segment discussing the merits of government imposed price controls to fight #inflation. I predicted price controls were coming long before anyone on @CNBC even knew inflation would be a problem. Not only did I see the problem coming but the wrong solution too!,0

@Day_VTweets Well avoiding large losses in #Bitcoin over the past year was a great move especially since the asset we did recommend did so well over the past year.,1
https://t.co/Nz1ukT175d,0
@ben_mckenzie It will likely be a very think book.  If you need any more material feel free to DM me.,0
@rhcp_steve I don't think so. With negative real yields there is still an incentive to borrow. The only change is what borrowers buy with  the money. Also negative interest rates will not encourage savings.,1
It looks like #bonds are about to crash and #gold is about to surge. This makes sense as both markets are primarily #inflation driven but in opposite directions. If these moves play out the dollar rally is about to reverse as crashing bonds and surging gold are #dollar bearish!,0
Bitcoin isn't a hard money alternative to the dollar or any fiat currency. #Bitcoin is neither hard nor money. It's a digit token that people collect and trade. Bitcoin's only value is the belief that it will make you rich. In the end those Bitcoin collections will be worthless!,0

@SantiagoAuFund Because #inflation is what will drive bond yields higher. Inflation also destroys the purchasing power of the dollar. Remember it's only nominal yields that are rising. Real yields are still falling!,1
Investors still don't realize how high bond yields will rise if the #Fed follows through with QT. As the Fed goes from being a buyer of Treasuries to a seller it goes from being Treasury's biggest customer to its biggest competitor just as #inflation premiums are about to soar!,0
Yields on 10-year Treasuries just topped yields on 30-year Treasuries. The yield curve is now inverted from 5s to 30s. The next step is for 2s to surpass 5s. The market clearly sees recession but is still oblivious to #inflation. Inflation won't return to 2%. It will exceed 10%!,1

The #bond market will keep falling until the #StockMarket crashes. If the stock market doesn't crash soon the bond market will crash instead which will cause a stock market crash. Then a #Fed pivot will cause a bear market rally in bonds until surging #inflation ends the rally!,0
As #interest rates on U.S. Treasuries close in on 3% it's important to remember just how historically low 3% is. It's also important to consider that this historically low rate coexists with historically high #inflation. This can't last. Interest rates are headed much higher!,0

@themoneycoach He did not just come off the battle field. He had time to apply makeup for the camera. His hair was combed. Not a strand was out of place and he had a clean shave and a trimmed beard. So he could have worn something less informal than a t-shirt. That's all I suggested.,0
#Powell admitted price stability is so important to the long-term health of the labor market that the #Fed may have to keep hiking interest rates to bring #inflation down even if unemployment rises. The same would apply to asset prices falling. This resolve will soon be tested!,0

The yield curve has now inverted from 5 to 10 years as 5-year Treasuries now yield more than 10-year Treasuries. This shows bond investors still don't get it. They are correct in thinking the economy is headed for recession but wrong to think that means #inflation will go away!,1
The only reason the #Fed hiked rates is #inflation. Prior to admitting inflation wasn't transitory the Fed wasn't planing any rate hikes in 2022. Given current geopolitical risks and weakness in the economy and financial markets the Fed just ran out of excuses to stay at zero!,0

Feb. export prices spiked 3% bringing the YOY rise to 16.6%. That increase reflects the cost of domestic production. Since costs to produce for export should be the same as costs to produce for domestic consumption 16.6% more accurately reflects #inflation than does a 7.9% CPI.,0

I understand times are hard but doesn't the President of the #Ukraine own a suit? I don't have much respect for current members of the U.S. Congress either but I still wouldn't address them wearing a t-shirt. I wouldn't want to disrespect the institution or the Unites States.,0
Congress just approved a record 21% increase in its allowance to pay its staffers. 21% is likely much closer to the actual #inflation rate than the 7.9% #CPI. Of course Congress and the #Fed cause inflation and these raises for staffers will just add to the pain for taxpayers!,1

@PeterLBrandt Some bear markets are more severe with 80% to 90% declines. I think that's more likely with $ARKK. That's especially true since many of the companies in this portfolio will run out of funding and go bankrupt. So this ETF won't likely bottom until it trades below $20.,0
@MXAddict @CathieDWood I except the #gold price to rise during that decline. So gold stocks should follow the metal. Plus I also expect the #Fed to cave somewhere along the way causing an even bigger rally in gold sending mining stocks soaring.,0
Don't be fooled into thinking the @CathieDWood $ARKK fund is a good value at $52.29 just because it's 67% below last year's $159.70 high. The fund is still up over 160% since its Oct. 2014 launch. However it looks poised to crash below $20 soon wiping out all of those gains!,0
@DogMidsize Yes I'm assuming the Fed hikes rates at least once before all that stuff happens.,0
If 10-year Treasury yields spikes to 3% which looks likely it's hard to imagine the Dow Jones now down less than 11% escapes a bear market. If the Dow drops 20% the S&amp;P will likely be down 30% and the NASDAQ 50%. If so what's the odds the #Fed keeps hiking rates or does QT?,0
"@BradHuston If by ""the same team"" you mean the team of people who dislike fiat currencies and believe in free market capitalism that yes we are on the same team. But I'm not on the team that believes in fiat digital currencies like #Bitcoin.",0
In case you haven't noticed the meme stocks are crashing. #GameStop is down another 15% today trading below $79 per share. That's down over 83% from last year's high. #AMC is down 5.5% today over 80% off its 2021 high. #Bitcoin HODLers pay attention. You're the next bagholders!,1
Imagine how much higher U.S. Treasury yields would be had #Russia not invaded the #Ukraine. The geopolitical risk raised caused capital to flee into Treasuries. Yet despite those safe-haven flows 10-year yields rose to 2.128%  Had Russia not invaded yields would likely be 2.5%!,0
Even though #Bitcoin is holding on to a small gain today shares of #Coinbase are hitting new lows down another 4.5% on the day. $COIN is now down about 65% from last year's peak. This is bad news for #crypto. How much longer will the bulls be able to keep Bitcoin from crashing?,1
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields are above 2.1%. If the #Fed raises rates and forecasts more hikes to come yields could spike to 3% within a month. If that doesn't prompt the Fed to pivot yields could top 5% by year-end. How will the economy and financial markets deal with that?,1
@ErikVoorhees I'm referring to the more recent correlations that #Bitcoin has developed.,1
For #Bitcoin to go up the NASDAQ must go up and #gold must go down. For that to happen the #Fed must succeed in bringing #inflation down to 2% without harming the economy which requires minimal rate hikes and big cuts to government spending. But in that scenario why own Bitcoin?,1
Peter Schiff with Tucker Carlson: Inflation Only Has One Way to Go! @schiffgold https://t.co/zWvcHHB4QJ,0
@rjsoltan @IOTFinancial @saylor You just think you understand both. But at least for your sake you own a lot of #gold.,1
@IOTFinancial @saylor That just proves that you don't understand gold. A lack of understanding of #gold is key to believing in the cult of #Bitcoin.,0
@CryptusNoobius @saylor Not sure but the energy wasn't wasted as it helped move #gold from below ground where it had not utility into a coin in my pocket where it has great utility.,0
@dissectmarkets @saylor #Bitcoin can't store what it doesn't have. All it has is a market price. You can't store price!,1
@saylor #Bitcoin doesn't channel energy it wastes it. It doesn't store or move anything. It's nothing like the actual infrastructure you reference to confuse people. All Bitcoin transfers is money from the people who are dumb enough to buy it to those who are smart enough to sell it!,0
@saylor Work is a means to an ends. It's worthless if the work itself doesn't create any real value. If I can prove I spent hours digging a hole and then spent an equal number of hours filling it back up with dirt my work produced nothing. All the work used to create #Bitcoin is wasted!,0

@Alex_hxrrison @ptj_official Yes #Bitcoin is up about that much when measured against the low that it crashed to in the early days of Covid. But that's an irrelevent benchmark to my point as most investors where still worried about deflation back then.,1
"When it comes to #inflation hedges @ptj_official was wrong to proclaim #Bitcoin to be ""the fastest horse in the race."" Over the past year with inflation finally perceived to be a threat the price of Bitcoin has fallen by 37%. In contrast the price of #gold has risen by 12%!",0

"@natbrunell @TuckerCarlson By ""orange pilled"" you mean telling a bunch of lies about #Bitcoin to con new suckers into buying thus enable existing holders to cash out before the market finally crashes for good.",0

Moreover in our view Tesla remains 3-4+ years ahead of the competition in battery costs and is in a world of its own in chip design and data assets for autonomous mobility: think Apple chip design for smart phones vis a vis Nokia Motorola Ericsson and Blackberry. New world.,1
Based on the historical demand response to a $25000 price point in gas-powered vehicles ARK's forecast that EVs will scale from ~8.5 million in 2022 to 60 million units - 75% of the market - during the next five years could be too conservative.,1
Tesla's goal has been to drive prices down and increase #EV adoption. At Investor Day (3/1) Elon could announce a step-function drop in pricing much like he did for the Model 3 to ~$25000 for the next gen EV. Gas-powered vehicles boomed at that price point. https://t.co/eBgDEFrZF5,0

Surprisingly the S&amp;P energy sector (XLE) price is not far from an all-time high even though the oil price has dropped from $130 per barrel to $74. Meanwhile many pure play early stage innovation stocks have dropped below their coronavirus lows. Truth will win out.,0
Typically an inverted yield curve is pointing to a recession and/or lower than expected inflation than expected. In our view deflation is a much bigger risk than inflation. Commodity prices and massive retail discounts are corroborating this point of view.,1
I am wondering why economists are not highlighting that an 80bp inversion in the Treasury yield curve today is much more of a red flag for the Fed today than it was in the early ‚Äò80s. As a percent of the 3.5% 10 year Treasury yield it is ~23% today vs ~5% of 15% in the ‚Äò80s,1
The bond market seems to be signaling that the Fed is making a serious mistake. At -80 basis points (as measured by the 10 year vs 2 year Treasury yields) the yield curve is more inverted now than at any time since the early ‚Äò80s when double-digit inflation was entrenched.,0

Clearly we should be rooting against Depression and for the Roaring Twenties. Given conflicting data and the stark difference in these outcomes the Fed should be debating the possible risks associated with its current policy at the very least instead of voting unanimously.,0
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Survey is at a record low below levels hit in 2008-09 and 1979-82 a setup for a liquidity trap like that in the Great Depression when massive monetary stimulus failed.,1
Unfortunately today has some echoes of the same. The Fed is ignoring deflationary signals and the Chips Act could harm trade perhaps more than we understand. Much like the reaction to Smoot-Harley economists have paid little attention to the potential impact of the Chips Act.,0
If the Fed does not pivot the set-up will be more like 1929. The Fed raised rates in 1929 to squelch financial speculation and then in 1930 Congress passed Smoot-Hawley putting 50%+ tariffs on more than 20000 goods and pushing the global economy into the Great Depression.,1
As inflation dropped to -15% in June 1921 the Fed lowered interest rates from 7% in May 1921 to 4% in July 1922 tripping the switch for the Roaring Twenties. From August 1921 to September 1929 the Dow Jones Industrial Average compounded at a annual rate of 25%.,1
If inflation drops below the Fed's 2% target and economic activity disappoints then interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations next year ushering in this century's rendition of the Roaring Twenties.,0
Founded in 1913 and challenged by its first bout of serious inflation the Fed raised interest rates less than two-fold from 4.6% to 7% in 1919-1920. Faced with much lower inflation this time around the Fed has increased interest rates 16-fold a serious mistake in our view.,0
During WWI and the Spanish Flu supply chain and other shocks pushed inflation to 20%+. At its worst in June 1920 inflation peaked at 24% but then dropped precipitously in one year to -15% in June 1921. We would not be surprised to see broad-based inflation turn negative in 2023,0
Prior to the Roaring Twenties the world was at war - WWI - and suffering a pandemic - Spanish Flu. While both had a more serious impact on the global economy today's combination is a strong echo that could result in much lower than expected inflation and a boom in innovation.,1
If inflation is unwinding as we believe then we could be heading back to the future the Roaring Twenties the last time several general purpose technologies evolved at the same time: telephone electricity and the internal combustion engine. The setup is remarkably similar!,1

Much like in the mid-eighties other central banks are foreshadowing or calling for an increase in dollar liquidity. In 1985 their calls for Fed/Treasury action culminated in the Plaza and Louvre Accords. We wouldn't be surprised to see more crises force something similar.,1
Responding to the the dollar's sharp rise the BOJ and PBOC are supporting their currencies - selling dollars and buying yen and yuan - while the Swiss National Bank has tapped the Fed's dollar swap facility for two consecutive weeks which it never did in 2008-09.,1
The UK's LDI crisis was the first rip in the global financial fabric caused by the Fed's unprecedented 13-fold interest rate hike. As a result the BOE has been forced to part company with the Fed and has resumed buying instead of selling gilts.,0
Second despite record-breaking monetary stimulus during COVID the yield curve steepened only ~half as much in 2020 as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù during past crises: 150 basis points vs. 250-300. In other words the long bond market seemed to be flagging a significant deflationary undertow.,0
.@Nancy__davis is highlighting a chart that is flagging the deflationary ramifications of current Fed policy.

For those skeptical of our interest rate shock thesis (13.5x increase in the Fed funds rate in this cycle compared to 2x under Volcker) the UK pension fund LDI debacle is proof of concept.,0
RT @ARKInvest: ARK is excited to share the exciting news of our partnership with @titanvest! Together we aim to democratize investing ena‚Ä¶,1
Japan's and China's dollar sales could be the first sign that ‚Äúmonetary easing‚Äù is on the way. The dollar's parabolic move has been devastating to the rest of the world and should come back to bite US competitiveness jobs and  and economic activity forcing the Fed to pivot.,0
Last week Japan and China sold dollars to protect their currencies against a parabolic dollar that is causing significant harm to the global economy. In other words they are starting to ‚Äúease‚Äù dollar-based monetary policy by putting more dollars into the system.,0
By the time this Fed tackled the current surge inflation had been brewing for ~15 months not 15 years. Now it is ‚Äúkeeping at it‚Äù with a sledgehammer 13 times more powerful than the one Volcker wielded in the ‚Äò80s. In so doing the Fed could undermine its legacy.,1
The inflation surge in the late seventies/early eighties had been brewing for 15 years starting with the  Vietnam War and The Great Society social programs in 1964 and exacerbated by the end of the gold-exchange standard in 1971.,1
A 58% increase in the trade-weighted dollar since early 2008 helps to explain the deflationary forces that are building in the pipeline once again. Most commodities are priced in dollars.,1
Meanwhile commodity prices as measured by Refinitiv's CRB index have dropped ~42% since their peak in mid 2008 ~25% since their lower peak in 2011 and ~19% since an even lower peak earlier this year.,1
Under Volcker the increase in long Treasury yields was 1.6X from 10% to 16% compared to 7.4X from 0.5% to 3.7% under Powell and team. Risk aversion is pummeling all assets except cash but the Fed seems fixated on hiking rates another 100+ basis points to protect its legacy.,0
In @ARKInvest's view US monetary policy is significantly more restrictive than in the ‚Äò80s when to kill inflation Fed Chair Volcker pushed the Fed funds rate up two-fold from 10% to 20%. Chair Powell and team have increased it 13-fold from 0.25% to 3.25% to slay the dragon.,1
The yield curve ‚Äúsuggests‚Äù that US monetary policy has not been this restrictive since the ‚Äò80s. As measured by the 2-year Treasury yield relative to the 10-year Treasury yield it has inverted by 50 basis points the 10-year yield at 3.75% compared to the two-year at 4.25%.,1

Demand destruction. Gasoline demand in the US has dropped below the level hit during the depths of the coronavirus in 2020 to levels last seen 25 years ago in 1997 even though the number of cars on the road - most of them gas-powered - is much higher than it was 25 years ago. https://t.co/MO9JG4UWnf,1
RT @elonmusk: @CathieDWood Yes the fundamental error is reasoning by analogy rather than first principles,1
This inflation started fewer than two years ago with COVID and supply chain bottlenecks exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year. The Fed is solving supply chain issues by crushing demand and in my view unleashing deflation setting it up for a major pivot.,1
Larry Summers seems to be leading the Biden administration astray with his conviction that inflation is intractable with the ‚Äò70s as his guide. The ‚Äò70s inflation started in 1964 with the Vietnam War and the Great Society and burgeoned for 15 years. https://t.co/Sq7NbKDOW1,1

This time around thanks to ride-hailing - and soon less expensive autonomous taxis - individuals are unlikely to prioritize auto debt payments over mortgage payments which could turn backward-looking quant models upside down.,0
If residual auto values deteriorate accordingly the $1+ trillion in US auto debt will be in harm's way. Autos were the best credit in 2008-09 as individuals prioritized their auto loan payments at the expense of mortgages so they could get to work and stay employed.,0
As measured by the Manheim used car prices dropped 4% in August (roughly 50% at an annual rate!) have dropped 10% since peaking in January and if electric vehicles are as disruptive as we believe could be cut in half hitting lows last seen during the GFC in late 2008.,1
Deflation in the pipeline heading for the PPI CPI PCE Deflator: from post-COVID price peaks lumber -60% copper -35% oil -35% iron ore -60% DRAM -46% corn -17% Baltic freight rates -79% gold -17% and silver -39%. https://t.co/nVpU1cdf1L,0
Innovation solves problems and the world is facing many more problems today than two years ago. Innovation is key to real growth!,1
The Fed seems to responding to COVID-related supply shocks spanning 15 months the same way that Volcker battled inflation that had been brewing and building for 15 years. I would not be surprised to see a significant policy pivot in the next three to six months.,0
Further downstream retailers seem to be swimming in inventories which they could be forced to discount aggressively to clear the shelves for holiday merchandise. The surprise could be deflation in the CPI and PCE deflator by year-end.,0
In the pipeline inflation is turning into deflation. One of the best inflation gauges the gold price peaked more than two years ago in August 2020 at $2075 and has dropped ~15%. Lumber prices have dropped more than 60% copper -30% iron ore -60% DRAM -46% and crude oil -35%.,1
The Fed has raised the Fed funds rate 10-fold from 0.25% to 2.50% five times Volcker's 2-fold increase from 10% to 20% in the early ‚Äò80s when consumers and businesses had been adjusting to inflation for 10-15 years. In contrast today they are in shock. Housing is unraveling.,1
Not ‚Äòtil Volcker took charge in 1979 15 years after the Vietnam War and Great Society began did the Fed attack inflation decisively. In contrast faced with a two year supply-related inflation shock Powell is using Volcker's sledgehammer and I believe making a mistake.,1
At Jackson Hole Chairman Powell invoked Volcker's name twice directly twice indirectly. Today's COVID-supply-shock inflation is nothing like the ‚Äò70s inflation that started with ‚Äúguns and butter‚Äù in 1964 and accelerated after Nixon ended the gold-exchange standard in 1971.,0
The Fed is basing monetary policy decisions on lagging indicators: employment and core inflation. Leading inflation indicators like gold and copper are flagging the risk of deflation. Even the oil price has dropped more than 35% from its peak erasing most of the gain this year. https://t.co/e45KJWrjOZ,0

In our view small businesses are trying to salvage profitability in what they perceive as recession. If they are correct and we believe they are then the profit margins of larger companies that are hoarding labor will suffer as their productivity collapses.,0
The household employment survey  incorporates more small businesses - the biggest source of job creation - than does the non-farm payroll measure of employment. Larger companies seem to be hiring - perhaps hoarding labor - to make up for past labor shortages.,0
While today's non-farm employment numbers were stronger than expected at +30000 adjusted for revisions the broader based and less reported household establishment employment number was -300000 confirming that the economy is in recession.    https://t.co/qbAkN6fSmj,1

‚ÄúInnovation solves problems‚Äù was my mantra during the COVID crisis. We now have a plethora of serious problems. Innovation solves problems.,0
Finally while the cartel and a war have pushed oil prices to levels I did not expect the equivalent of a highly regressive tax has accelerated the consumer preference shift to electric vehicles. I still believe that the shift to EVs will undermine oil prices.,1
If inventories and stock prices are leading indicators for employment and wages which in this case I believe they are then fears of cost-push inflation a la 1970's should disappear during the next six months.,0
One of the best leading indicators of inflation is gold. After soaring from $1350/ounce pre-COVID to a peak of nearly $2000 during 2020 the gold price has dropped back to $1840 during the past two years and the lumber price has dropped more than 50%.,1
Volcker doubled the Fed funds from 10% to 20% in less than a year. Powell's Fed has increased the funds rate 7-fold in the last year and is pointing to another double from here. Its moves already are more draconian than Volcker's.,1
As measured by the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is lower today than levels reached during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-09 and the two recessions in 1980-82 when Fed Chairman Volcker was choking 15%+ inflation with 20% interest rates.,1
In our view the US fell into recession during the first quarter. If massive inventors bloat real GDP in the second quarter they will unwind and hurt growth for the rest of the year. Alarmingly in early June consumer sentiment fell to a record low extending back to the 1940s.,0
Limiting the yield curve to only 150bp of steepening in the face of massive stimulus the bond market may have recognized the deflationary forces that CDSs are flagging. At the lowest end of the capitalization structure broad based equity indexes are seizing up as well.,0
The yield curve - as measured by the difference between 10 and 2 year Treasury yields - has flattened a harbinger of recession. In fact despite record breaking monetary and fiscal stimulus the yield curve steepened only to 150 basis points (1.5%) not the typical 250-300bp.,0
As measured by Markit credit default swaps (CDS) - insurance policies against bankruptcies - have doubled this year surpassing their peaks during the market rout in late 2018 and heading for COVID crisis levels. Money center bank CDS spikes are particularly concerning.,0
The Fed seems to be worried more about its legacy than the economy: it is ignoring deflationary and dangerous signals. Relying on lagging inflation indicators like the CPI Fed Governor Waller is calling for another hike of 0.75% in July.,0

I trust that Fed Chairman Powell and the Federal Reserve Governors and Presidents are evaluating more than the short term supply chain bottlenecks that may have been caused by over- ordering and now are showing up Walmart's and Target's record-breaking inventories!,1
Consistent with this line of thinking credit default swaps - the price of insurance policies against default as measured by Markit - are surging the yield curve is flattening - portending disappointing growth and/or lower inflation - and stock prices are plummeting.,0
Now that the growth in M2 has declined to low single digits at an annualized rate during the last few months if the velocity of money does decline then we will be facing the risk of price deflation.,0
I believe that after flattening out for the past two years the velocity of money will resume the decline that started in 1997 and accelerated during the coronavirus. The dramatic decline in consumer sentiment and spending during the last few months corroborates this thinking.,0
US consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan - the best measure in my experience - has plunged to levels not seen since the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Consumers are rebelling against their loss of purchasing power.,1
Walmart's inventories increased 33% in nominal terms on a year over year basis translating into 20-25% in real or unit terms as Target's inventories increased by 42% and 30-35% respectively. In my 45 years in this business I have never seen such inventory excesses.,0
Important debate. In the last two days Walmart and Target reported that nominal sales increased 3-4% on a year over year basis during the quarter ended April translating into a 3-4% year over year decline in unit sales (adjusted for inflation). Their inventories are exploding. https://t.co/i4dQKM0Hbb,0

Another metric suggests that Fed policy already is too restrictive: the dollar. Against expectations the dollar has increased more than 13% from its lows last year a real burden for emerging and other markets with dollar-denominated debt and a powerful deflationary force.,0
Equities and bonds seem to be warning the Fed that its policy measures could cause an economic and/or financial crisis: equities are swooning and the yield curve is nearly negative territory.,0

US consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan is lower today than it was at the depths of the coronavirus crisis. It has entered 2008-09 territory and is not far from the all time lows in the 80's when inflation and interest rates hit double digits.,1
The 10-year to 3 month yield curve is steep because the Fed is telegraphing aggressive interest rate hikes in the face of inflation that has been stoked by supply shocks. Inflation is a highly aggressive tax that is killing purchasing power and consumer sentiment.,0
Economists have learned over many cycles that the 10-2 year measure of the yield curve leads another one: the difference between the 10 year Treasury yield  and the 3 month Treasury rate. I have no idea why many strategists and economists are reverting to the latter one now.,0

In our view fears of inflation will give way to confusion and fears of recession during the next three to six months. If so the rapid growth rates of truly innovative companies many of their equities maligned this year should be rewarded handsomely.,1
This buildup along with M&amp;A and IPOs reminds me of Y2K. This time the excesses are likely to be  in industries that technology will disrupt: energy financial services and transportation among others. If so this disruption will be the flip side of Y2K completing the circle.,1
These developments are not new. During the third quarter real GDP was up a little more than 2% at an annual rate but real final sales - consumption investment excluding inventories government spending net exports - were flat. That 2% growth was all in inventories.,0
These percent changes are not annualized so multiply them by 12 to understand the drama unfolding here in the US. Both businesses and consumers seem to have overreacted to supply chain bottlenecks by building ‚Äúinventories‚Äù of goods while government stimulus was flowing freely.,1
As measured by the University of Michigan which I believe is the best monthly survey on the consumer sentiment during November and December dropped to a level last seen at the worst of the coronavirus crisis in 2020. In this context the percent changes listed above make sense.,0
Today we learned that in November retail inventories rose more than 2% the fastest pace since the 90's while imports jumped 4.7% and exports dropped 2%. Moreover real consumption (including services) was flat and the saving rate dropped to 6.9% below pre COVID levels.,1

Today yes soaring food and energy prices are the equivalent of extremely regressive and oppressive tax increases. In the not-too-distant future innovation - including EVs and gene-editing - will deliver the equivalent of massive tax cuts. @ARKInvest is investing in innovation. https://t.co/tzhiODOlfI,1
The consensus view is that inflation will remain an issue and could get worse suggesting that the equity and fixed income markets are incorporating it into discount rates. Deflation would be the bigger surprise. @ARKInvest is open minded and would like to continue this dialogue!,0
I am struck by the behavior of millennials who at the margin are sacrificing short term consumption to pay down student loans or invest in crypto and other assets. Bank loan growth also is tepid which would not be the case if velocity were increasing.,0
If they expect lower prices most consumers/businesses will defer purchases exacerbating a decline in the velocity of money. Despite the burst in cyclical inflation during the last year velocity is hovering at low levels. If @ARKInvest is correct the next leg will be down.,0
Inflation has flared in response to COVID-related supply chain bottlenecks and oil supply constraints but IMHO the powerful and converging deflationary forces associated with AI energy storage (EVs!) robotics genomic sequencing and blockchain technology will bend the curve. https://t.co/DxGLRWe2P6,1
Truth always wins!,1
In response to the near quadrupling of oil prices since the low last year electric vehicle adoption has accelerated sowing the seeds of a serious oil price decline longer term.,1
On the supply side ESG (environmental social and governance) mandates have forced energy companies to shift capital spending from mature fossil fuels to nascent renewables. Meanwhile banks have deprived fracking companies of funding after their near-death experience in 2020.,0
Oil has had three sources of support on the SUPPLY side. Global DEMAND for oil is below that in 2019 and is unlikely to return to its old high partly because its price has broken a string of lower highs and is above the $77 hit in 2018 therefore destroying demand.,0
As a result once the holiday season passes and companies face excess supplies prices should unwind. Some commodity prices - lumber and iron ore - already have dropped 50% China's crackdowns are one of the reasons. The oil price is an outlier and psychologically important.,1
The third and most controversial source of deflation is cyclical. Because businesses shut down and were caught flat-footed as goods consumption took off during the coronavirus crisis they still are scrambling to catch up probably double- and triple-ordering beyond their needs.,1
They leveraged their balance sheets to pay dividends and buy back shares ‚Äúmanufacturing‚Äù earnings per share. They have not invested enough in innovation and probably will be forced to service their debts by selling increasingly obsolete goods at discounts: deflation.,1
The second secular source of deflation could be creative destruction thanks to disruptive innovation. Since the tech and telecom bust and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-09 many companies have catered to short-term oriented shareholders who want profits/dividends now‚Ä¶.,1
When costs and prices decline velocity and disinflation - if not deflation - follow. If consumers and businesses believe that prices will fall in the future they will wait to buy buy goods and services pushing the velocity of money down.,1
Artificial intelligence (AI) training costs for example are dropping 40-70% at an annual rate a record-breaking deflationary force. AI is likely to transform every sector industry and company during the 5 to 10 years.,0
Now we believe that three sources of deflation will overcome the supply chain-induced inflation that is wreaking havoc on the global economy. Two sources are secular or long term and one is cyclical. Technologically enabled innovation is deflationary and the most potent source.,0
In 2008-09 when the Fed started quantitative easing I thought that inflation would take off. I was wrong. Instead velocity - the rate at which money turns over per year - declined taking away its inflationary sting. Velocity still is falling. https://t.co/tFaXSaCKqS,0

By the time autos recover strongly if @skorusARK's analysis is correct the sticker prices of #ElectricVehicles will be at or below those of like-for-like gas powered vehicles suggesting that traditional auto companies will have to transform from ~95% gas to majority electric.,0
As mass transit and ride-sharing continue to recover during the next year or so many consumers could conclude that they have prepaid too much for transportation in the form of those extra cars.,0
Because consumers bought new and used cars to avoid mass transit during the past year the V-shaped recovery in autos was more dramatic than that after most of the more prolonged recessions during the past 50 years.,1
Back to the #auto industry the inventory glut is not on dealer lots: auto manufacturers have only 17 days of supply in the pipeline much lower than the normal 60+ days. As is the case for many goods that we stocked during the last year the inventory is in homes and garages.,1
Since spring prices of lumber have dropped 64% iron ore -51% DRAM chips -20% and copper -15%. When companies build inventories in anticipation of demand that does not materialize and inventory losses threaten their financials they sell exacerbating the price declines.,0
Chips are not alone. After the disproportionate spending on goods that caused shortages before vaccinations became available this spring the shift to spending on services could transform other commodity shortages into gluts pushing prices down and dissipating inflation fears.,1
We would not be surprised to see chip supplies loosen up considerably perhaps turning the problem from a shortage into a glut given the weakness in gas-powered auto demand. @elonmusk $AMD's Su and $GM's Carlisle are on record saying chip supply constraints are easing.,0
Addressing the chip shortages in the last two weeks the Biden Administration has threatened to invoke a traditional war-time measure the Defense Production Act which would force companies to disclose supply chain information including chip inventories.,1
In @ARKInvest's view traditional auto manufacturers have been building chip inventories since April when their US sales peaked at more than 18 million units and then dropped more than 30% (65% at an annual rate!) over the next five months to 12.2 million in September.,1
Today $TSLA announced that in the third quarter it sold 241300 vehicles globally up 73% year over year (YoY) and 20% quarter over quarter (QOQ). Meanwhile $GM blamed the ~33% YoY decline in its US sales on chip shortages. What? #EVs require 3-5x more chips per car produced!,1
The rise in oil prices this year is a function more of supply than demand. At the turn of the 20th century whale oil faced the same fate and whale oil prices fluctuated dramatically. If @ARKInvest's research is correct oil prices will suffer the same fate as whale oil prices.,1
That said based on ESG mandates pension funds are demanding that oil companies cut back on capital spending while US banks in response to the collapse in oil prices last year are denying fracking companies of loans for capital spending and OPEC is holding the line on supply.,1
According to the EIA global oil demand peaked at 101 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2019 dropped to 92 mbd during the coronavirus crisis in 2020 and has rebounded to 97 mbd in 2021. Based on our forecast for EV sales @ARKInvest believes that oil demand has peaked. https://t.co/jLNkvYi22i,1

To his credit Michael Burry made a great call based on fundamentals and recognized the calamity brewing in the housing/mortgage market. I do not believe that he understands the fundamentals that are creating explosive growth and investment opportunities in the innovation space.,1
In our view the seeds for the innovation explosion that @ARKInvest is dedicated to researching were planted during the 20 years ending with the tech and telecom bust. Having gestated for more than 20 years these technologies should transform the world during the next 10 years.,1
If we are correct GDP and revenue growth will diminish until the opportunities in nascent technologies begin to move macro needles. In this environment innovation based strategies should distinguish themselves.,0
The deflation in commodity prices is cyclical but is adding to the secular forces caused by technologically enabled disruptive innovation (‚Äúgood deflation‚Äù) and creative destruction (‚Äúbad deflation‚Äù).,1
Since mid May a number of commodity prices have been breaking down: lumber -65-70% copper -10-15% oil -10%. An unexpected increase in the dollar also is negative for commodity prices. Now the Mannheim used car index - a leading index for new car sales - is slipping.,1
The equity market is likely to reward disruptive innovation strategies once again when headline inflation breaks and/or fears of recession increase. If the bond market is correct one or both will be obvious during the next 3-6 months.,1
Unlike the tech and telecom bubble this equity bull market has broadened beyond the innovation strategies that boomed last year to value and other stocks that had trailed. The bull market has strengthened setting the stage we believe for another leg up in innovation strategies.,1

The source for the ratio of the US equity market cap to GDP is https://t.co/DOdGRcqvug a website dedicated to the Buffet indicator. @ARKInvest will research this metric pre-WWII to assess its validity.,1
‚ÄúThis time is different‚Äù are dangerous words in forecasting markets. Most forecasters use post World War II history as their guide. On that basis never has the equity market been higher relative to GDP. In the late 1800's however it seems to have been 2-3 times higher.,1
Deflation should lower the velocity of money a mirror image of the seventies. If consumers and businesses expect prices to fall many will defer spending. As a result the rapid growth in global money is unlikely to unleash generalized inflation except perhaps in asset prices.,0
Bad Deflation: ‚ÄúCreative destruction‚Äù could compound the deflation. Since the tech and telecom bust many companies have catered to short-term oriented shareholders leveraging balance sheets to repurchase shares and pay dividends while neglecting to invest enough in innovation.,1
Good Deflation: The deflationary forces associated with the five major platforms evolving today could be much more powerful than those caused by telephone electricity and the automobile.,1
The technologically-enabled innovation evolving today dwarfs that of the late 1800s/early 1900s: genomic sequencing robotics energy storage artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Moreover Bitcoin could be today's ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù increasing purchasing power!,1
As deflation pressured an increasingly difficult-to-measure nominal GDP (the denominator) exponential unit growth and rapid productivity gains increased the quality of earnings while low interest rates boosted their capitalization (the numerator).,0
Telephone electricity and the automobile were the three major technology-enabled platforms during the 50 years that ended in the Roaring Twenties. Technology-enabled platforms are deflationary thanks to learning curves or Wright's Law. The Gold Standard also was in force.,0
In the late 1800's and early 1900's - as telephone electricity and the automobile were emerging - the US equity market cap relative to GDP appears to have been 2-3 times higher than it is today. We need to verify this difficult-to-get data but if true I have a hypothesis. https://t.co/7V4dNo3vBL,1
RT @ARKInvest: Next Tuesday is our #mARKetUpdate webinar which means it's time to ask ARK! What questions do you have for @CathieDWood &amp; t‚Ä¶,1
Investors need to get and stay on the right side of change.,0
Companies that did not innovate and instead leveraged up to buy back stock and distribute dividends to satisfy short-term oriented shareholders including private equity will pay a steep price. They will have to cut prices to move aging inventory and service debt. Bad deflation.,0
One more thought: @ARKInvest believes that the massive amount of disruptive innovation and good deflation evolving today is causing creative destruction and bad deflation elsewhere.,1
After gestating for 20-30 years the dream has turned into reality but given the reactions to @ARKInvest's research many investors seem skeptical or reticent. This wall of worry is healthy: I would prefer to invest in the face of fear than exuberance!,0
The seeds for the explosion in innovation today were planted during the tech and telecom bubble in the late nineties. Back then investors chased the dream before the tech was ready and while costs were too high.,1
If deflation limits the long term Treasury yield to low single digits the discount factor used to present value future cash flows probably will fall to surprisingly low levels during the next few years a massive head fake in the face of higher inflation expectations.,0
The technologically enabled innovation evolving today is dwarfing that during any other period in history. It is creating ‚Äúgood deflation‚Äù and explosive demand. Battery technology is a good example. In @ARKInvest's view EVs will scale 15-20 fold in the next five years.,1
GDP statistics evolved during the Industrial Age and do not seem to be keeping up with the digital age. Thanks to productivity real GDP growth probably is higher and inflation lower than reported suggesting that the quality of earnings has increased significantly. https://t.co/7V4dNo3vBL,1

Ed Hyman a well-respected economist concocted this back of the envelope calculation to illustrate a point. Why did the PE of the S&amp;P 500 top out regularly at 20-25X as the 10-year Treasury bond yield declined from 6% to 0.5%? https://t.co/jm5LTzyPIt,0
Oh yes I forgot to mention how scarce exponential growth opportunities are likely to become as #artificialintelligence creates more winner-take-most opportunities like autonomous taxi networks!,0
The PE on the S&amp;P 500 is likely to adjust to 2-3% nominal GDP growth as disruptive innovation creates ‚Äúcreative destruction‚Äù in the traditional world order. If 10-year Treasury yields were to settle in the 2-3% range the S&amp;P 500's PE would adjust accordingly: 1/.03=33.,1
The equity market does not seem ever to have discounted 0.5% 1% 2% or 3% yields on the 10 year Treasury bond. The PE on the S&amp;P 500 has topped out at 20-25X regularly since the tech and telecom bust even as 10-year Treasury yields have declined from 6%. https://t.co/lb5jTvJ0PQ,0

Passive investing is unlikely to keep pace with the exponential growth of the five innovation platforms and 14 technologies evolving today. In our view S&amp;P is depriving benchmark-sensitive investors of some of the most important investment opportunities in the world like $TSLA.,1

@elonmusk Ah yes. Thanks for flagging. I meant the $25000 car which some are calling the Model 2 as shown in our ARK Disrupt Weekly Newsletter this morning. https://t.co/uh76avGNvt https://t.co/pxqNjEz0nk,1
The auto industry has not enjoyed exponential growth in roughly 100 years. EVs have entered exponential growth territory that will last for the next five to ten years.,1
According to @skorusARK's battery research #EV sales will scale nearly 20-fold from roughly 1.8 million last year to 35 million 40% of total global auto sales during the next five to six years.,0
Analysts following $TSLA should be expert in energy storage robotics artificial intelligence and software-as-service. While they are expert at the internal combustion engine traditional auto analysts are not equipped to analyze EVs particularly $TSLA.,0
According to Wright's Law for every cumulative doubling in the number of EVs produced costs will drop by 28% suggesting that EV prices will drop below those of gas powered vehicles on a like-for-like basis during the next two years.,0
Traditional auto analysts are analyzing a mature industry in which lower prices signal trouble: higher inventories and lower sales. Led by #Tesla electric vehicles (EVs) are in their infancy and BECAUSE of lower costs and prices are moving into exponential growth trajectory.,1
Predictably when @elonmusk announced at Battery Day last week that $TSLA would cut the price of a Model 3 to $25000 several financial analysts panicked downgrading the stock and/or cutting their price targets. In our view traditional financial analysts have missed the mark.,1
As @sbarnettARK elucidates in this extensive tweet thread $ILMN - with 85-90% share of the DNA sequencing market - is entering a crowded molecular diagnostic testing market and will be competing with its customers a questionable strategy. https://t.co/wpUflBCqhz,1
With my apology to $GS which was not monitoring the order book before it filled. That said I do believe that our $GS sales trading contact with whom we interacted many times for updates should have explained the difference between Dutch and Unified auctions. Lessons learned.,0
I stand corrected: $U did a Unified auction not a Dutch auction something completely new to me. With thanks both to my compliance team and to a long time professional friend Lise Buyer Partner at Class V Group LLC for steering me correctly. https://t.co/8jpEzm7zBt,1
Didn't $ILMN take its ownership of  #GRAIL down from 100% to 14% at a much lower valuation to avoid competing with its customers? https://t.co/hDnjDtgUYV,0
.@GrousARK has done some of the most provocative and differentiated research on #gaming in the financial services industry. We are excited to share our forthcoming blogs and white papers during the next few months.,1
I am sure that $GS disclosed this twist in many documents but it never apprised us despite discussions with its sales traders of our clear desire to gain exposure to $U. Did $GS's highest revenue generating customers get the word? I don't want to be in that club. Just wondering.,0
Apparently $GS introduced a Dutch auction twist that did not require it to inform those who had committed to a price above the ‚Äúrange‚Äù that the range had changed unless the ‚Äúindicated price range‚Äù had increased by 20%+. Excuse me?,0
Some of us who placed bids above the initial 40-44 indicated range and then raised our bids above the revised 44-48 range assuming that our bids would be filled learned the hard way that we would receive nothing. Very few things surprise me in this business but this one did.,1
Equity Dutch auctions were designed to democratize initial public offerings. In 2014 I founded @ARKInvest to help democratize investing in the innovation space. Despite best intentions this week $U went public in a Dutch auction sponsored by $GS that we believe missed the mark.,0
According to @skorusARK research other companies focused on EVs are three to four years behind $TSLA in battery technology already. The question is whether these breakthroughs will help #Tesla pull away even faster.,0
Are they more fundamental breakthroughs? Would a 90%+ decline in each of the three important variables - assembly line labor costs cell cost saving per unit of energy and factory floor space - change the slope of the line accelerating the decline in costs from 18%?,0
Thank you for this detailed and thoughtful analysis! @ARKInvest is debating whether these advancements will keep Tesla on pace with Wright's Law: an 18% decline in the cost of EV's battery pack systems for every cumulative doubling in EV demand or https://t.co/8CrcWqZJqV,1

Now that $TSLA has 80% and 23% share of the US and Chinese #EV markets respectively and has been profitable for the last 4 quarters it is likely to join the ‚Äúbig leagues‚Äù the indexes. Oh and it is up roughly 5-fold since it troughed in March to more than $250B in market cap.,1

Oil demand probably hit a secular peak last year and thanks to #EVs now is in secular ‚Äúdecline‚Äù. Though ARK has no formal forecast I believe that #Oilprices are on their way back to $12 the level reached after the 1973 oil cartel crisis or lower now that EVs are taking off.,0

Check out https://t.co/4GzS1p8NNC for our thoughts on the relationship between disruptive innovation and inverted yield curves.,1
Then electricity telephony and the internal combustion engine were the disruptive innovations.  Today the five major innovation platforms are DNA sequencing robotics energy storage AI and blockchain technology.,1
We have been expecting this flat to inverted yield curve for some time thanks to good deflation and strong unit growth associated with disruptive innovation.  The last time the economy experienced this kind of deflationary boom was in the 50 years which ended in the Roaring 20's,1
The average inversion during the 50 years ended 1929 was 100 basis points with the steepest occurring during periods of very strong growth.  Short rates averaged 4.9% and long rates 3.9%.,1
The #invertedyieldcurve is the latest brick built into the wall of worry which is great for this bull market. While it has foreshadowed every recession in post WWII experience during the 50 years ended in the Roaring 20's the yield curve was inverted more than 60% of the time. https://t.co/WUbXUu0jsv,1

Three years ago ARK's forecast for EV sales in 2022 looked ridiculous at 17 million. Our forecast has not changed.  The EIA's forecast for 2022 has gone up &gt;10-fold to roughly 3.5 million and if Wright's Law is correct it will have to increase its forecast another 5-fold.,1
Wright's Law also has helped us forecast how quickly the demand for #EVs would scale. Three years ago the EIA and other forecasting agencies were expecting 200-300000 EV sales in 2022. Last year global EV sales were 1.45 million. https://t.co/MsVJ7NVAZq,1

Back to the future?  Yes!,1
During the 50 years ended 1929 electricity telephony and the internal combustion combined to turbocharge unit growth and lower inflation.  The yield curve was inverted more than half of the time back then with the steepest inversions during periods with the strongest growth.,0
The yield curve is giving us clues that after more than one hundred years truly disruptive innovation and exponential growth have returned. Technologically enabled ‚Äúgood deflation‚Äù should increase broad based purchasing power and turbochargers volume growth.,1
Our bull case assumes that #Tesla loses one-third of its 17% global EV market share during the next five years and that its autonomous strategy succeeds in which case our five- year price target is $4000-$6000.,1
In an attempt to remain conservative our bear case assumes that $TSLA loses two-thirds of its 17% global EV market share during the next five years and that its autonomous strategy fails in which case our five-year price target is $560.,0
Based on Wright's Law our models suggest that global #EV sales will increase nearly 20-fold during the next five years from roughly 1.4 million last year to 26 million in 2023. $TSLA should capture a significant share of the market.,0
The last wave of innovation - exponential growth - was not the #Internet.  It was electricity telephony and the ICE in the late 1800's/early 1900's. Our shift from R&amp;D to PP&amp;E reflects a more aggressive pivot from trucks and utility storage to EVs based on recent EV demand.,1
Because the investment world has been built on the linear growth industries that have evolved in post WWII experience $TSLA's exponential growth strategy seems out of place if not impossible. Post WWII does not incorporate the last great wave of innovation.,0
This week @elonmusk highlighted in an internal email that #Tesla's second quarter deliveries could surpass those in the fourth quarter breaking another record.  If so $TSLA should shift R&amp;D dollars to #EV capex to pull even further ahead on its autonomous vehicle strategy.,0
The shift in our model from spending from R&amp;D to PP&amp;E during the next five years is based on the demand metrics for #Tesla's EVs that are surfacing around the world Check out not only the US but also Norway which the bears wrote off after subsidies lapsed last year.,1
Based on #Tesla's stunning results year-over-year in the first quarter relative to the $GM Bolt - the Model 3 sales up 6-fold from a base more than 50% higher than the Bolt's while the Bolt's sales were flat - $TSLA should go full throttle in EV production.,0
Negative responses to our open-source $TSLA model focus on changes we made to PP&amp;E and R&amp;D while maintaining our price targets.  Those responses highlight the short term time horizon of analysts in the public markets and their unwillingness/inability to model exponential growth. https://t.co/wFTUHprO9t,1
Interestingly on Friday $TSLA hit its 100 month moving average roughly the same place that $AMZN hit before beginning its eight year climb from 35 to 2000. Perhaps the HFTs and algorithms that dominate trading these days will take note. We shall see.,1
As the record shows$TSLA has contributed positively to the performance of our strategies since inception. Importantly we have traded it aggressively in the 141-387 trading range in place since our inception in 2004 while maintaining it as our first or second largest position.,1
Led by our DoR @wintonARK our analysts - @TashaARK @skorusARK and @jwangARK - are contributing important research to the investment community. Our $TSLA model and assumptions are on GitHub. We are grateful for the contributions others are making to make it more robust.,0
Centered on Wright's Law our first principles research is the reason for my conviction that $TSLA is as profound an investment opportunity today as was $AMZN 10-15 years ago.,1
Now that its success is obvious in hindsight most sell-side analysts remember that I bucked conventional wisdom and applauded the fact that Amazon was investing aggressively to capitalize on the inevitable shift to e-commerce and #AWS at the expense of short-term profits.,0
$TSLA during the past five years reminds me of $AMZN from 2004-2009. Investors/speculators laughed at worst or were baffled as we bought the stock when it tanked into the 20's and 30's in a 25-120 trading range. Trading recently at $2000 #Amazon is one of my best stocks ever.,1
Thank you Eric for pointing out how many stocks are doing so well for us!  Interestingly no one said anything on Twitter last year when $TSLA was up roughly 50% from its low and 25% in the fourth quarter. #Tesla was a great diversifier when other stocks were getting crushed. https://t.co/Y1P22Fe3N6,1
.@ARKInvest analyst @mfriedrichARK is researching and surfacing not only the significant gap in valuations between the public and private markets but also the beneficial rights that late stage venture investors are extracting to get these deals done at such high valuations.,1
I am surprised that large asset managers like #Fidelity and $TROW that are participating in both the public and private markets aren't arbitraging this significant gap in valuations. Don't their private and public equity teams compare notes.  Don't they talk to one another?,0
The valuation gaps between companies focused on the same kind of innovation in the private markets vs. public markets can be stunning: Formlabs at 10X revenues vs. #Stratsyss at 2x is a good example.,1
Large public market asset managers contributed to this void as they have tried to capture more ‚Äúalpha‚Äù by moving funds from the public equity markets to the pre IPO markets during the past five to ten years.,0
Because of late stage #VC funding #innovation in the private markets is incredibly overvalued.  In the public markets innovation is undervalued a void created partly by backward-looking passive and benchmark-sensitive strategies. https://t.co/sIg8ZU7aZY,0

Also interesting to note Jonas cut his worst case price by more than 90% but left his price target unchanged at $230. So I guess he is suggesting that the probability of the bear case has dropped significantly and/ or the probability of the bull case has increased. https://t.co/Digxee8IOn,0
I'd be much more concerned about the demand for gas powered cars.  I'm puzzled over Adam Jonas's ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù rating on $GM because the #Bolt's sales are flat year over year and its gas powered car sales are falling.  Gas powered car sales seem to have peaked globally.,0
Increasingly when #UBER drivers drop me off at the train they ask about the economics of the #Model3. Demand for the Model 3 extends well beyond the premium sedan market.,0
As the average price of an EV moves toward and drops below that of gas powered cars in the next few years EV demand growth should transition from strong to explosive.,1
Based on original research (which seems rare on the Street these days) the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a $TSLA's Model 3 is lower than that of the average gas powered vehicle as shown in ARK's Sunday newsletter above.,1
.@ARKInvest would like to compare notes with Adam Jonas and his team at Morgan Stanley on their concern about EV demand. The concern should be about gas-powered cars. EVs are growing nicely. https://t.co/EyG8BYEe81,0
By our estimates $GM #Bolt sales were flat on a year-over-over basis at roughly 5000 in Q1 while $TSLA Model 3 sales were up more than six-fold from roughly 8200 to 50000.,0

The message here is one of great hope!  I believe that we should be inspiring educating and encouraging the #Uber drivers and others who aspire to better lives - and most do - to pursue careers associated with disruptive innovation.,1
The innovation platforms evolving now will be net job creators and as productivity ramps so will wages.,1
Job displacement will be an issue but the college loan crisis is putting a spotlight on the ROI of higher education relative to apprenticeships nano degrees and professional certificates from online short courses and other forms of training.,1
According to @skorusARK's research #robots that work alongside humans collaborative robots will permeate most industries and leverage the productivity of humans as they drop toward $10000 per robot during the next five to ten years.,0
.@ARKInvest believes that five innovation platforms spawning 14 technologies will cause much stronger than expected productivity growth turbocharging economic activity.  Opportunities to move up the economic ladder will be plentiful.,1
After a long slide productivity growth is accelerating once again and will benefit both wages and profitability perhaps the former more than the latter because of labor shortages.,1
Another POV on this issue @jwangARK and @andrewchen: Raw labor is becoming more valuable now that the unemployment rate in the US is plumbing new lows and 7.5 million jobs are vacant because they don't pay enough or because of a skill-set mismatch. https://t.co/ntp3LYy1ls,0

@HODL_Report @ARKInvest @elonmusk Well that's what makes a market!,1
@HODL_Report @ARKInvest @elonmusk Brilliant visionaries who are convinced their innovations will change the world and make it a better place are passionate. They can't understand the siloed and short-term thinking that informs the questions and complaints they are facing. They need to let others face the Street.,1
@HODL_Report @ARKInvest @elonmusk I also remember Bezos saying that he would pour every penny of cash flow back into the business which drove analysts nuts and hurt the stock from 2002 to 2006 but those who kept eyes on the prize were rewarded handsomely.  Truth wins out.,1
"@HODL_Report @ARKInvest @elonmusk Jobs is in print saying ""I will spend my last dying breath...and every penny of Apple's $40 billion.... I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this"" and lobbed expletives during the interview.",1
